1st investigation is CT coronary Angiogram. 
# Mx of Stable angina
1. [[beta adrenergic receptors|beta blocker]] or [[calcium channel blockers|CCB]] as first line
	1. Don't give beta blocker to [[asthma- drugs|asthmatic]].
	2. Calcium-channel blockers, with the exception of amlodipine, should be avoided in heart failure.
	3. If CCB is used as monotherapy, use rate controlling CCB: Verapamil/Diltiazem -> This helps prevent reflex tachycardia on top of already reducing myocardial contractility.
	4. Add statin + Aspirin + GTN spray.
2. if poor response to initial treatment then medication should be increased to the maximum tolerated dose (e.g. for atenolol 100mg OD)
3. If still no response/cant tolerate one, then either try the other, or
4. Try both Beta blocker + CCB together (but make sure no left ventricular dysfunction/conduction problem).
	1. In combo, try DHPs instead: Nifedipine MR/Amlodipine/Felodipine cuz risk of bradycardia if both beta blocker and a rate limiting CCB like non-DHP get used.
	2. Also, starting patients on non-rate-limiting CCBs may cause reflex tachycardia initially, risking worsening angina symptoms; as such, patients will often be started on a beta-blocker alongside their amlodipine
5. But if one of these is c/I and still poor response with just the other one, then
	1. Long acting nitrate (ISMN)
	2. Ivabradine
	3. Nicorandil (Nicorandil induces vasodilation of arterioles and large coronary arteries by activating potassium channels.)
	4. Ranolazine can be added.
6. If patient is taking both a beta blocker and a CCB, then only add a third drug while a patient is awaiting assessment for PCI or CABG.

# Nitrate tolerance
- Many patients who take nitrates develop tolerance and experience reduced efficacy
- NICE advises that patients who take standard-release isosorbide mononitrate should use an asymmetric dosing interval to maintain a daily nitrate-free time of 10-14 hours to minimise the development of nitrate tolerance
- this effect is not seen in patients who take once-daily modified-release isosorbide mononitrate
