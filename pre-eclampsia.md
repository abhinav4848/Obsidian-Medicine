# Pre-eclampsia
New HTN > 140/90 + Proteinuria ( > 0.3g/24 hr. 1+) after 20th week of gestation.
**Gestational HTN**: New onset HTN after 20 weeks. 
## Symptoms
- Frontal headache
- Visual disturbance (flashing lights and blurring)
- Epigastric or RUQ pain- more commonly associated with HELLP
- Nausea/vomiting
- Rapid edema: especially face, and, feet
## Signs
- BP > 140/90 or > 160/110 severe
- Proteinuria > 300mg in 24 hrs/dipstick ++ to +++
- Facial edema
- Papilledema 
- Epigastric/RUQ tenderness due to liver involvement and capsule distension 
- Confusion or neurological disturbance 
- Hyperreflexia or clonus: Signs of cerebral irritability 
- Uterine tenderness or vaginal bleeding from placental abruption
- Fetal growth restriction (SGA <10th centile) or IUGR on USS
- [[platelets|Low platelet count]] < 100 * 10^6/L, abnormal liver enzymes or HELLP syndrome
	- Can lead to haemorrhage: placental abruption, intra-abdominal, intra-cerebral
# Management
## BP
Labetalol is 1st line for pre-eclampsia and gestational HTN
- Labetalol is 3rd-gen cardioselective with vasodilatory properties. 
- Avoid if [[asthma#Drugs to avoid in Asthma|Asthma]] & use [[calcium channel blockers|Nifedipine]] instead. 
- Methyldopa is pregnancy safe -> Women on methyldopa need an alternative drug within 2 days of delivery. Methyldopa not used cuz risk of postnatal depression. But all are safe in breastfeeding. 

Moderate HTN: 140/90 - 159/109 
	Labetalol 1st line
	Reduce to 135/85 

Severe HTN: 160/110 
	Admit + Oral Labetalol + iv MgSO4 if h/o eclamptic fit. 
	MgSO4 is not used solely to lower BP.
	Don't offer delivery if <34 weeks. 

If not effective or woman has good control with [[calcium channel blockers|Nifedipine]] from before, to continue with nifedipine throughout the pregnancy. BP should be monitored regularly during pregnancy as it may reduce during pregnancy in which case the meds may be withheld until after 20 weeks or delivery, when BP starts to rise again.
## Proteinuria
Proteinuria ( >0.3g/24 hr. 1+) 
*\>3g/24hr. is [[nephrotic syndrome]]*
- Albumin-Creatinine ratio (ACR) > 8mg/mmol
- Protein-Creatinine ratio (PCR) > 30mg/mmol
A comes before P. #mnemonic 
8 comes before 30. 

Proteinuria 1+ & <140/90 (normotensive): review & assess in 1 week in GP clinic. 
Proteinuria 1+ & >140/90: urgent referral same day 24 hrs. 
Proteinuria 2+: urgent referral same day 24 hrs. Even if normotensive.

# Prevention
NICE divide risk factors into high and moderate risk: 

| High risk factors                                                                                                                                                              | Moderate risk factors                                                                                                                                                                               |

| - hypertensive disease in a previous pregnancy<br>- chronic kidney disease<br>- autoimmune disease, such as SLE, APLA<br>- type 1 or type 2 diabetes<br>- chronic hypertension | - first pregnancy<br>- age 40 years or older<br>- pregnancy interval of more than 10 years<br>- BMI of 35 kg/m² or more at first visit<br>- family history of pre-eclampsia<br>- multiple pregnancy |
## Aspirin 
- women with the following should take aspirin 75-150mg daily from 12 weeks gestation until the birth
	- ≥ 1 high risk factors
	- ≥ 2 moderate factors
- Aspirin is c/i in [[breastfeeding]].
- Women with APLA take Aspirin + LMWH.

# Eclampsia
GTCS + pre-eclampsia
(but GTCS can rarely occur both in postpartum period, and w/o h/o Preeclampsia). 
## Treatment
We can give diazepam (but don’t give diazepam before [[magnesium|MgSO4]], even if GTCS). 

Control/prevent seizure: MgSO4 (repeat iv bolus if another fit)
	**Loading dose**: 4g in 100ml NS over 5-10 mins  
	**Maintenance**: 1g/hr. for 24 hrs. after last seizure.
If recurrent seizure: either give 2gm bolus, or increase infusion to 1.5 - 2g/hr.
