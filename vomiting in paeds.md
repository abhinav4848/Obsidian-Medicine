Refusal to feed.<br>Gagging/choking/regurgitation during feeds, faltering growth.<br><br>**Difference with cow milk allergy** <br>If considering non-IgE mediated cow's milk protein allergy<br>- Look out for loose or frequent stools, perianal redness, blood &/or mucus in stools in an otherwise well infant<br>- Symptoms delayed. Mostly within 2 - 72 hours after ingestion of cow's milk protein.<br><br>**If considering IgE mediated cow's milk protein allergy**<br>- Acute pruritus, urticaria, angioedema (symptoms occur mostly within minutes but may be up to 2 hours after ingestion of cow's milk protein)<br>- **Rx**:  Hydrolysed milk<br><br>Advice (ignore for exam): Calculate feed volume: 150ml/kg/day in bottle fed infants, smaller & frequent feeds. Overfeeding is common cause of reflux.<br><br>**Rx:**<br>- Treatment of GORD involves [[gastroprotection\|Gaviscon]] (alginate).<br>- Omeprazole is also part of the management but Gaviscon is first tried. <br>- Trial of thickeners like anti-reflux milk formula: Carobel added to the formula. |
