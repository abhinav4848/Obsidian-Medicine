Watch out for monitoring vs pre-treatment in the question.

# Mnemonic:
1. Statins --> liver problems so just LFTs
2. ACEi --> well we all know it is bad for kidneys so U&Es
3. MTX --> horrible drug that effects Liver + Kidney + Blood so FBC, U&Es and LFTs. Besides MTX almost has a THREE in it. hmmmm interesting
4. Azathioprine --> wants to be like MTX but lacks the kidneys. So it can only to get a deal for FBC and LFTs
5. LiThiUm --> meany of a drug. We need to keep an eye on it. Also TFTs and U&Es (can not think of a way to remember this. damnnnn)
6. Sodium valproate --> fat people love salt, which is basically Sodium. And fat people have fatty livers so better keep an eye on LFTs
7. Glitazones --> Diabetic drugs, which is usually given to fat people (cause you know every fat person is a diabetic (its a joke calm down before being pissed)). And as above, fat people have fatty livers so better keep an eye on it
