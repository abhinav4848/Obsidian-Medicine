Inflammation of optic nerve.
Swollen optic disc (like [[papilledema]]). 

# Clinical Features
Reduced colour vision (initially of red colour -> i.e. Red desaturation #named ).

Eye pain on eye movement/exercise
Uhthoff's phenomenon: #named  Worsening of eye pain following rise in Body temp.
Often has Central scotoma (macular degeneration), but if RAPD seen -> Monocular visual field loss (this is also seen in [[amaurosis fugax]])

# Cause:
- [[Multiple sclerosis]]
- DM, Syphilis
- [[drugs that can cause ocular problems|Drug induced]]: Ethambutol, Amiodarone, [Metronidazole](onenote:#Pharma&section-id={210C3954-BE8B-A24C-8E7F-F1B991349700}&page-id={7138171D-7A77-48F3-98E0-98EEDA80D74B}&object-id={566323AD-6847-4BD6-A1CB-B0A4009A995D}&D&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/450c0e1b0b9c7922/Documents/Onenote/MBBS/PLAB%201%20+%20MSRA.one).

Inv:

MRI of the brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast is diagnostic in most cases

Rx: steroids  
 

for MS:

for acute cases (during a relapse) (initial)-> Oral or i.v. Methylprednisolone  
Long term -> Glatiramer acetate or Interferon Beta.

Rapd

Also known as the Marcus-Gunn pupil, a relative afferent pupillary defect is found by the 'swinging light test'. It is caused by a lesion anterior to the optic chiasm i.e. optic nerve or retina  
  
Finding  
the affected and normal eye appears to dilate when light is shone on the affected  
  
Causes  
retina: detachment  
optic nerve: optic neuritis e.g. multiple sclerosis  
  
Pathway of pupillary light reflex  
afferent: retina → optic nerve → lateral geniculate body → midbrain  
efferent: Edinger-Westphal nucleus (midbrain) → oculomotor nerve
