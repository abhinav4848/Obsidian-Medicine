Inflammation of optic nerve.
Swollen optic disc (like [[papilledema]]). 

# Clinical Features
Reduced colour vision (initially of red colour -> i.e. Red desaturation #named ).

Eye pain on eye movement/exercise
Uhthoff's phenomenon: #named  Worsening of eye pain following rise in Body temp.
Often has Central scotoma (macular degeneration), but if RAPD seen -> Monocular visual field loss (this is also seen in [[amaurosis fugax]])
## Cause:
- [[multiple sclerosis]]
- DM, Syphilis
- [[drugs that can cause ocular problems|Drug induced]]: [[tuberculosis|Ethambutol]], Amiodarone, [[Metronidazole]].
## Investigation 
MRI of the brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast is diagnostic in most cases
## Treatment
steroids

# for MS:
for acute cases (during a relapse) (initial)-> Oral or i.v. Methylprednisolone  
Long term -> Glatiramer acetate or Interferon Beta.
## [[confusion in ophthalmology|RAPD]]
Also known as the Marcus-Gunn pupil, a relative afferent pupillary defect is found by the 'swinging light test'. It is caused by a lesion anterior to the optic chiasm i.e. optic nerve or retina  
## Finding 
the affected and normal eye appears to dilate when light is shone on the affected  
## Causes
retina: detachment  
optic nerve: optic neuritis e.g. multiple sclerosis

# Pathway of pupillary light reflex
afferent: retina → optic nerve → lateral geniculate body → midbrain  
efferent: Edinger-Westphal nucleus (midbrain) → oculomotor nerve
