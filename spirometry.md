Normal ratio of FEV1:FVC is 0.8
# Obstructive Lung Diseases
They have FEV1/FVC: <0.7
#confusion 
## Asthma
BDR with spirometry is [[asthma- diagnosis#Second line investigation|2nd line test]] to diagnose asthma. Here, spirometry improves after bronchodilators (reversible obstruction). 
Also, [[asthma- investigations#Peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability|asthma worse at night]] & early morning so Peak flow will show variability

See [[asthma- severity assessment|Assess severity of asthma]] for the grading of Asthma severity.

## COPD
[[copd|COPD]]: FEV1/FVC remains <0.7 even after bronchodilator. This can be expressed in percentage, so <70%. 

| Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC | FEV1 (of predicted) | COPD Severity                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| < 0.7                        | > 80%               | Stage 1 - Mild - symptoms should be present to diagnose COPD in these patients |
| < 0.7                        | 50-79%              | Stage 2 - Moderate                                                             |
| < 0.7                        | 30-49%              | Stage 3 - Severe                                                               |
| < 0.7                        | < 30%               | Stage 4 - Very severe- consider [[long term oxygen therapy\|LTOT]].            |

Ratio of <0.7 needed for diagnosis of COPD. 
Severity then classified using the FEV1 % of predicted.
Don't do [[copd- treatment#Asthmatic Features|new BDR to check for Asthma]] features in COPD, as it can be misleading as per NICE.

# Restrictive Lung Diseases
(FEV1/FVC > 0.7)
FEV1 ↓, FVC ↓, ratio normal or ↑

See [[restrictive lung diseases]]

---
# Nuances
- Asthma - reversibility is pathognomonic. FEV1/FVC can be normal non-obstructive.   
- [[Bronchiectasis]] - only in severe cases can develop into obstructive pattern but most patients with bronchiectasis have normal FEV1/FVC
