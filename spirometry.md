# Obstructive cause(FEV1/FVC: <0.7)
#confusion 
## Asthma
BDR with spirometry is [[asthma- diagnosis|2nd line test]] to diagnose asthma. Here, spirometry improves after bronchodilators (reversible obstruction).
Also, [[asthma- investigations#Peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability|asthma worse at night]] & early morning so Peak flow will show variability
## COPD
[[copd|COPD]]: FEV1/FVC remains <0.7 even after bronchodilator.

| Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC | FEV1 (of predicted) | COPD Severity                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| < 0.7                        | > 80%               | Stage 1 - Mild - symptoms should be present to diagnose COPD in these patients |
| < 0.7                        | 50-79%              | Stage 2 - Moderate                                                             |
| < 0.7                        | 30-49%              | Stage 3 - Severe                                                               |
| < 0.7                        | < 30%               | Stage 4 - Very severe                                                          |
**Frequent Exacerbation**: Defined as >=2 exacerbations in the last 12 months despite being on triple inhaled therapy. 

Hyperinflated lung on CXR: > 7 ribs seen.

Ratio of <0.7 needed for diagnosis of COPD. 
Severity then classified using the FEV1 % of predicted.

If couldn't diagnose, do treat to diagnose method with 6 week course of ICS (or few days of Oral steroid)-> If symptoms (Wheeze, SOB, cough) improve-> Asthma.

# Restrictive cause
(FEV1/FVC > 0.7)

Pulmonary fibrosis, [[Sarcoidosis]]
