# Differences

| Pattern         | FEV₁   | FVC         | FEV₁/FVC ratio     | Key Point                        |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Normal**      | Normal | Normal      | ~0.8               | Normal lung function             |
| **Restrictive** | ↓      | ↓           | Normal or ↑ (>0.7) | Reduced volumes; preserved ratio |
| **Obstructive** | ↓      | Normal or ↓ | <0.7               | Airflow limitation               |

# Obstructive Lung Diseases 
## Asthma
#### See [[asthma- diagnosis (algorithm)|Algorithm for Asthma Diagnosis]]. 
- BDR with spirometry is [[asthma- diagnosis (algorithm)#Second line investigation|2nd line test]] to diagnose asthma. Here, spirometry improves after bronchodilators (reversible obstruction). 
- Peak flow will show variability, as [[asthma- investigations#Peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability|Asthma worse at night]] & early morning.

## COPD
[[copd|COPD]]: FEV1/FVC remains <0.7 even after bronchodilator. This can also be expressed in percentage, so FEV1/FVC <70%. 

| Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC | FEV1 (of predicted) | COPD Severity                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| < 0.7                        | > 80%               | Stage 1 - Mild - symptoms should be present to diagnose COPD in these patients |
| < 0.7                        | 50-79%              | Stage 2 - Moderate                                                             |
| < 0.7                        | 30-49%              | Stage 3 - Severe                                                               |
| < 0.7                        | < 30%               | Stage 4 - Very severe- consider [[long term oxygen therapy\|LTOT]].            |

Ratio of <0.7 needed for diagnosis of COPD. 
Severity then classified using the FEV1 % of predicted.
Don't do [[copd- treatment#Asthmatic Features|new BDR to check for Asthma]] features in COPD, as it can be misleading as per NICE.

# Nuances
- Asthma - reversibility is pathognomonic. FEV1/FVC can be normal non-obstructive.   
- [[Bronchiectasis]] - only in severe cases can develop into obstructive pattern but most patients with bronchiectasis have normal FEV1/FVC
