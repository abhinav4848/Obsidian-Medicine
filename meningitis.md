After treating meningitis, arrange hearing test cuz it's the most likely complication. But most likely outcome is complete recovery.
# Causes
- **Bacterial**: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes
	- Bacteria eats glucose and poops protein. #mnemonic 
- **TB**: low glucose, high lymphocytes
- **Viral**: Normal glucose, high lymphocytes.
	- Coxsackievirus is the most common cause of viral meningitis in adults

*Compare [[Encephalitis]]*

# Diagnosis
CT shows meningeal enhancement.

If rash developed: 
- Blood culture (Meningococcal septicaemia -> Neisseria meningitidis)
- The rash is ==non-blanching==.

if w/o rash
- Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis

Bacterial CSF look same (turbid, purulent), but if
- No rash: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal meningitis)
- rash: Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus)  
## Lumbar puncture contraindicated if:
- Increased ICP
- Bulging, tense fontanelle
- Ongoing [[seizure]]
- GCS < 9 or a drop of >=3
- Unequal, dilated, unresponsive pupils
- [[papilledema]] 
- If there's Meningococcal septicaemia -> cuz then you risk introducing it to brain.

# Treatment
Treat even if suspected meningitis.
### Suspected meningococcal disease in GP clinic
- [[benzylpenicillin]] I.M. /IV 
	- If meningitis suspected, GP to administer single dose of ben pen before hospital transfer. 
	- Mortality rates are significantly reduced by pre-hospital antibiotics. 
	- Do not administer antibacterial treatment outside of hospital if history of severe allergy to a beta-lactam antibacterial.
- Can also give Ceftriaxone
### Hospital/A&E
- <3m: iv amox/ampi + iv cefotaxime (avoid steroid).
- 3m - 60yo: Ceftriaxone/Cefotaxime empirical. (*3rd gen cephalosporin*)
	- *Even [[gonorrhoea]] has same abx.* 
- If > 60yo, add i.v. ampicillin/amoxicillin to ceftriaxone to also cover listeria.

If hypersensitivity to penicillin/cephalosporins: Chloramphenicol

**Listeria meningitis**: Ceftriaxone + Amoxicillin
- Gentamicin only if confirmed. 
- Pregnant individuals, elders, newborns, immunocompromised are most susceptible. It can cross placenta and can kill baby in late pregnancy.

**Cryptococcal meningitis**
- Amphotericin B
## Meningitis prophylaxis for contacts/household people
Prophylactic Ciprofloxacin (preferred) or Rifampicin if they've had close contact within the 7 days before onset. 

Vancomycin is used in conjunction with cefotaxime for empirical treatment of suspected meningococcal disease in patients with prolonged or multiple use of other antibacterials in the last 3 months, or if travelled, in the last 3 months, to areas outside the UK with highly penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant pneumococci.

| Scenario                                           | BNF recommendation                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Initial empirical therapy aged < 3 months          | iv cefotaxime + amoxicillin (or ampicillin)                  |
| Initial empirical therapy aged 3 months - 59 years | iv cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone)                               |
| Initial empirical therapy aged > 60 years          | iv cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone) + amoxicillin (or ampicillin) |
| Meningococcal meningitis                           | iv benzylpenicillin or cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone)           |
| Pneumococcal meningitis                            | iv cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone)                               |
| Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae        | iv cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone)                               |
| Meningitis caused by Listeria                      | iv amoxicillin (or ampicillin) + gentamicin                  |
If the patient has a history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to penicillin or to cephalosporins the BNF recommends using chloramphenicol.

# Steroids
NICE advise against giving corticosteroids in children younger than 3 months

Dexamethsone should be considered if the lumbar puncture reveals any of the following:
- frankly purulent CSF
- CSF WCC >1000/microlitre
- raised CSF WCC + protein concentration > 1 g/L
