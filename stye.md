A stye (hordeolum) can present in a similar fashion to [[chalazion]] but it's tender & it happens when the gland becomes infected (usually with staph aureus) which causes pain/soreness.

A stye can be internal or external.
- external -> they originate from the glands of Zeiss or Moll.
- internal -> they originate from the Meibomian glands.
# Treatment
For Simple styes -> conservative measures like warm compresses.
Rarely incision and drainage are required.
