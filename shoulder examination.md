Shoulder is not one joint but four: 
- Two true joints: glenohumeral and acromioclavicular (AC)
- Two pseudo-joints: subacromial space and scapulothoracic space
In assessing a patient with a shoulder disorder, the history and examination need to separate out these four joints.

People coming with shoulder pain can have many different problems. 
- ACJ osteoarthritis if tender on the front
- GH joint if tender on the outside of shoulder
- subacromial problem if pain on abduction
- Frozen shoulder is more likely in elderly > 50yo

# Test approach
Inspection: When not being supervised, you'll see all in one go anyway. 
Palpation: Comment on muscle wasting
Examination: Do active and passive combined. 
Some people just test the following:
1. External and internal rotation against resistance straight away. 
2. Abduction
3. Jobe
4. Scarf (to save time, only test the affected side)
