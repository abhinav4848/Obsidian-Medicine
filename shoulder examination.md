Shoulder is not one joint but four: 
- Two true joints: glenohumeral and acromioclavicular (AC)
- Two pseudo-joints: subacromial space and scapulothoracic space
In assessing a patient with a shoulder disorder, the history and examination need to separate out these four joints.

People coming with shoulder pain can have many different problems. 
- ACJ osteoarthritis if tender on the front- palpate it. 
- GH joint if tender on the outside of shoulder
- subacromial problem if pain on abduction
- Frozen shoulder is more likely in elderly > 50yo
- Impingement: Have normal movement but painful. If halfway up or from halfway, possible impingement. If at the top (ACJ arthritis) 

# Test approach
Inspection: When not being supervised, you'll see all in one go anyway. 
Palpation: Comment on muscle wasting
Examination: Do active and passive combined. 

[[shoulder exam.canvas]] 

1. External and internal rotation passively (you rotate it) & actively against resistance. 
2. Abduction
3. Jobe/Empty can (supraspinatus muscle or nerve pathology)- Do both hands thumbs down in one go and push down on the hand ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC_5Lmy7iAo))
4. Scarf (to save time, only test the affected side)

# Findings
Bilateral morning stiffness: [[polymyalgia rheumatica]]
