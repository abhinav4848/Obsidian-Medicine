Resting tremors, lead pipe, cogwheel rigidity (an increased tone that has a 'ratchety' feel due to superimposed tremor), Psychiatric: Depression.

In idiopathic Parkinson, upward gaze is more affected

In [[supranuclear palsy]], down gaze is more affected.

# Treatment
For first-line treatment:
- If the motor symptoms are affecting the patient's quality of life: levodopa
- If the motor symptoms are not affecting the patient's quality of life: dopamine agonist (non-ergot derived), levodopa or MAO‑B inhibitor

| Improvements               | Levodopa | Dopamine agonists | MAO‑B inhibitors |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Motor symptoms             | More     | Less              | Less             |
| Activities of daily living | More     | Less              | Less             |
| Motor complications        | More     | Fewer             | Fewer            |
| Adverse events             | Fewer    | More              | Fewer            |

- Motor complication: Dyskinesia/Chorea/athetosis (involuntary writhing movements) -> If seen, add Dopamine agonist, MAO-B-i, COMT-i.
- Adverse events (seen most with Dopamine agonists): excessive sleepiness, hallucinations and impulse control disorders.

|                            | Dopamine agonists       | MAO‑B inhibitors     | COMT inhibitors     | Amantadine                         |

| Change in Motor symptoms   | Improvement             | Improvement          | Improvement         | No evidence of improvement         |
| Activities of daily living | Improvement             | Improvement          | Improvement         | No evidence of improvement of ADLS |
| Off time                   | More off‑time reduction | Off‑time reduction   | Off‑time reduction  | No such outcome                    |
| Adverse events             | Intermediate risk       | Fewer adverse events | More adverse events | No such outcome                    |

# Drugs
Levodopa
- Given with a decarboxylase inhibitor (Carbidopa, Benserazide)
- **S/E**: Dry mouth, psychosis, [[eating disorder|anorexia]], postural hypotension, on-off phenomenon, Dyskinesia at peak dose (dystonia, chorea, athetosis).

Dopamine receptor agonists
- Ergot derived: bromocriptine, cabergoline -> can cause heart/[[lung fibrosis]].
- Non-Ergot: Ropinirole, apomorphine
- s/e: Impulse control, daytime sleepiness, postural hypotension

MAO-B-i: Selegiline
COMT-i: Entacapone, Tolcapone.
Antimuscarinics: Used to treat drug induced PD. e.g. procyclidine, benzotropine, trihexyphenidyl (benzhexol)

## Other Treatments in PD
Impulse control disorders: More common with
- dopamine agonist therapy
- a history of previous impulsive behaviours
- a history of alcohol consumption and/or smoking

Excessive daytime sleepiness: Modafinil if alternative strategies fail.

If orthostatic hypotension: Midodrine (acts on peripheral alpha-adrenergic receptors to increase arterial resistance)

Drooling of saliva in people with PD: Glycopyrronium bromide to manage.
