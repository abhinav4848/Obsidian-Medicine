# CRAO
ICA -> Ophthalmic Artery -> CRA.
Sudden, painless, u/l [[loss of vision]] due to embolism/thrombotic disease at site. 
[[confusion in ophthalmology|RAPD]]- the retina is ischemic and not transmitting light perception. 
Associated with [[polymyalgia rheumatica|giant cell arteritis]]. 
Visual loss may have been associated with transient loss of vision in the past ([[amaurosis fugax]]) if embolic sources. 

## Fundoscopy
- pale/white retina (ischemia), 
- cherry red spot on macula (cuz it's supplied by a different artery),
- Vessels attenuation

# BRAO
After entering the eye, the central retinal artery divides into superior & inferior branches. 
In CRAO, patients complain of visual loss over entire field of vision, while BRAO complain of hemifield defect.
