An upper gastrointestinal bleed can act as a 'protein meal' and cause a temporary, **disproportionate rise in the blood urea**.
# Causes
1. **Oesophageal**: 
	1. Varices ([[cirrhosis|liver cirrhosis]]), 
	2. Oesophagitis (in GORD- only streaks vomit, as small volume of blood), 
	3. cancer (Usually small volume of blood, except as a preterminal event with erosion of major vessels), 
	4. Mallory-Weiss tears #named (due to repeated vomiting)
2. **Gastric**: 
	1. Ulcer (small, low volume bleeds- can present as IDA), 
	2. cancer (h/o prodromal symptoms like dyspepsia), 
	3. Dieulafoy lesion #named : (AV malformation which has no prodrome, can produce considerable haemorrhage, and can be hard to detect endoscopically), 
	4. Diffuse erosive gastritis (Underlying cause like NSAID use).
3. **Duodenal**: Ulcer (pain occurs several hours after eating), Aorto-enteric fistula (can be an imp risk in patients with previous AAA surgery)

**Risk assessment**
- Glasgow-Blatchford #named score at first assessment- helps clinicians decide whether patients can be managed as outpatients or not.
# Treatment 
GI bleed is dealt by medical team. Not surgeons.
## Initial steps
- iv fluids
- if considering variceal bleed ->Terlipressin 2mg iv repeated every 4-6 hrs. & prophylactic antibiotics ([[ciprofloxacin]], Cephalosporin) #abx to be given to patient *before* endoscopy. 
	- *give 3rd gen cephalosporin > Tazocin/Carbapenem*

If unstable (Hypotensive) -> iv fluids before endoscopy. 
If iv fluids done but still unstable -> Emergency endoscopic band ligation.
## Endoscopy
Band ligation > injection N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate for patient with gastric varices > Sengstaken-Blakemore tube if uncontrolled haemorrhage > TIPS if above fails.

## Others
If liver disease patient with Hematemesis + High INR -> Give FFP.
If low platelet (<50,000) -> Platelet transfusion.
INR prolonged -> Vit K.

# Prophylaxis
Long term prophylaxis of variceal bleed
- Propranolol
- Endoscopic variceal band ligation
- TIPSS
