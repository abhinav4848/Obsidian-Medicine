# Targets
## LDL
Patients with CVD risk <10% will benefit from lipid lowering therapy if LDL >2.6mmol/L on more than two occasions despite lifestyle measures.
#### Primary Prevention
- Q risk < 10: LDL-C <2.6
- Q risk >10: LDL-C <1.8
#### Secondary prevention
- LDL < 1.4

## TG
Management of hypertriglyceridemia aims to reduce the risk of pancreatitis.
If TG > 10, check for symptoms of pancreatitis. 

Fasting: 2-5mmol/L
- Primary Prevention
	- Q risk < 10: Target LDL <2.6
	- Q risk > 10: Same Target as above
- Secondary Prevention
	- If after max tolerated lipid lowering agents, patient still having fasting TG >= 1.7 & LDL-C b/w 1.04 - 2.6, try Isocapent ethyl. But if still above target, A&G
Fasting: >5 to <20
Non Fasting >20 -> check eGFR > 60 & choose treatment accordingly.
