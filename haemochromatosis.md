Autosomal recessive #genetics 
Disorder of iron absorption and metabolism, leading to iron accumulation. 

It's most prevalent in people of European descent, making it more common than [[cystic fibrosis]].

# Clinical Features
- Early symptoms: Fatigue, erectile dysfunction, arthralgia (often of hands).
- Bronze skin pigmentation #named 
- Diabetes mellitus
- Liver: Stigmata of chronic liver disease- Hepatomegaly, [[Cirrhosis]], Hepatocellular deposition
- Cardiac failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy. 
- Hypogonadism (due to cirrhosis & pituitary dysfunction- hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).
- Arthritis

# Investigation
Ferritin.
Consider hemochromatosis in a person with T2DM & raised Liver functions (ALT>AST). A normal ferritin will rule out hemochromatosis.

There are rare cases of families with classic features of genetic haemochromatosis but no mutation in the HFE gene.

** Whilst elevated liver function tests and hepatomegaly may be reversible, cirrhosis is not.
