# Investigation
NICE: All women with macroscopic or microscopic haematuria with a suspected UTI, send MSU to confirm infection. This differs from guidance where haematuria is not present. 

send a urine culture if:  
- aged > 65 years  
- visible or non-visible [[haematuria]]

If infection was confirmed; Re-test the urine for blood with a dipstick after completing treatment to ensure that the haematuria resolves.

See [[cancer- urology|urological cancer]]. 
# Treatment
Treat with Nitro/[[Trimethoprim]]. #abx

**Non-pregnant female**: 3 days 
Extend antibiotics to 5-10 days if: 
- Impaired renal function
- abnormal urinary tract
- immunosuppression

## Males
- 7 days of abx. 
- Send MSU in all cases before starting abx.
- NICE: _'Referral to urology is not routinely required for men who have had one uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI).'_
- for prostatitis ([NICE](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/prostatitis-acute/diagnosis/suspecting-acute-prostatitis/))- [[ciprofloxacin]], ofloxacin, or Trimethoprim 200mg BD for 14 days. 

## Pregnant women
Pregnant female: 7 days (for symptomatic or asymptomatic bacteriuria)
- [[trimethoprim]] [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|c/i in first trimester]] ([[folic acid|anti-folate]])
- [[nitrofurantoin]] should be avoided near term
	- *can give amoxicillin or cefalexin*
- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria** is treated because there's high risk of progression to acute [[pyelonephritis]]. 
- A further test-for-cure MSU should be sent after treatment. 
- women who suffer regular urinary tract infections following sexual intercourse can be offered *post-coital antibiotic prophylaxis*- single dose trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin are used first-line. 

## Catheterised
- do not treat asymptomatic bacteria in catheterised patients. 
- if the patient is symptomatic they should be treated with an antibiotic
    - a 7-day, rather than a 3-day course should be given
    - consider removing or changing the catheter asap if it's been in place for longer than 7 days
