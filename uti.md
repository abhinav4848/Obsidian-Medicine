# Investigation
NICE: All women with macroscopic or microscopic haematuria with a suspected UTI, send MSU to confirm infection. This differs from guidance where haematuria is not present. 

send a urine culture if:  
- aged > 65 years  
- visible or non-visible [[haematuria]]

If infection was confirmed; Re-test the urine for blood with a dipstick after completing treatment to ensure that the haematuria resolves.

See [[cancer- urology|urological cancer]]. 
# Treatment
Treat with Nitro/Trimethoprim. #abx

**Non-pregnant female**: 3 days 

Extend antibiotics to 5-10 days if: 
- Impaired renal function
- abnormal urinary tract
- immunosuppression

## Males
- 7 days of abx. 
- Send MSU in all cases before starting abx.
- NICE: _'Referral to urology is not routinely required for men who have had one uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI).'_

## Pregnant women
Pregnant female: 7 days (for symptomatic or asymptomatic bacteriuria)
- trimethoprim [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|c/i in first trimester]]
- nitrofurantoin should be avoided near term
- *can give amoxicillin or cefalexin*
- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria** is treated because there's high risk of progression to acute [[pyelonephritis]]. 
- A further test-for-cure MSU should be sent after treatment. 
- women who suffer regular urinary tract infections following sexual intercourse can be offered *post-coital antibiotic prophylaxis*- single dose trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin are used first-line.
