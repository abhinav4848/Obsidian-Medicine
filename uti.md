# Investigation
NICE: All women with macroscopic or microscopic haematuria with a suspected UTI, send MSU to confirm infection. This differs from guidance where haematuria is not present.

send a urine culture if:  
- aged > 65 years  
- visible or non-visible haematuria

If infection was confirmed; Re-test the urine for blood with a dipstick after completing treatment to ensure that the haematuria resolves.
