| Tonsillar cancer          | Elderly, smoker/alcohol, Plummer Vinson | Dysphagia & painful swallowing, progressive hoarseness, persistent sore throat (weeks), lump in throat, palpable lump on anterolateral part of neck, central ulcer that bleeds on touch. Commonly involves mandible (then trismus also) |

# 2WW for mouth lesions
2 week wait referrals to oral surgery should be done in all of the following cases:
- Unexplained oral ulceration/mass for >= 3 weeks
- Unexplained red, or red+white patches -> painful, swollen or bleeding (erythroplakia)
- Unexplained one-sided pain in the head and neck area for > 4 weeks, which is associated with ear ache, but does not result in any abnormal findings on otoscopy (acoustic neuroma)
- Unexplained recent neck lump, or a previously undiagnosed lump that has changed over a period of 3 to 6 weeks
- Unexplained persistent sore or painful throat
- Signs and symptoms in the oral cavity persisting for > 6 weeks, that cannot be definitively diagnosed as a benign lesion

The level of suspicion should be higher in patients who are > 40, smokers, heavy drinkers and those who chew tobacco or betel nut (areca nut).
