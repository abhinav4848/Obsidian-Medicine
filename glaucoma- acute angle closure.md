Normal pressure in the eye is approximately between 10 and 21 mm Hg.
# Risk factors:
**Hypermetropia** (far-sightedness), Pupillary dilation, [[citalopram]] (SSRI).
Worsens with mydriasis-> h/o being in a dark room (movie theatre, eye clinic)
# Clinical features:
Coloured halos (also in cataract) #confusion , [[red eye]], photophobia
Semi-dilated, non reacting pupils
Corneal edema: dull or hazy cornea.
Associated with: nausea, Vomit

Cluster headache doesnâ€™t have halos. #confusion 
# Investigation
Do IOP test: Ocular tonometry-> Anterior chamber affected

# Treatment
## Eye drops
- Topical Pilocarpine (cholinergic agonist) 1-2%: cause pupillary constriction -> it's meiotic,
- Topical beta blockers (Timolol, except in [[Asthma]]),
- Topical alpha-2 agonists (apraclonidine, brimonidine) -> decreases production of aqueous + increases drainage.
## Intravenous
- i.v. Acetazolamide: reduce secretions,
## Others
- Steroids to reduce inflammation
- Anti-emetics

## Definitive treatment
After stabilizing, urgently refer to ophthalmologist  
peripheral iridotomy -> both eyes treated.
