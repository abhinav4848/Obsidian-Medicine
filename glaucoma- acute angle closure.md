**Normal pressure** in the eye is approximately between 10 and 21 mm Hg.
## Risk Factor: 
- hypermetropia (far-sightedness), 
- Pupillary dilation, 
- [[citalopram]] (SSRI).

Worsens with mydriasis-> h/o being in a dark room (movie theatre, eye clinic)

# Clinical features:
- Coloured halos (also in [[cataract]]) #confusion , [[red eye]], photophobia
- Semi-dilated, non reacting pupils
- Corneal edema: dull or hazy cornea.
- Associated with: nausea, Vomit

*[[headache|Cluster headache]] doesn’t have halos.* #confusion 
Do IOP test: Ocular tonometry-> Anterior chamber affected

# Medical Treatment
#### Eye drops
- Topical Pilocarpine (cholinergic agonist) 1-2%: cause pupillary constriction -> it's meiotic,
- Topical beta blockers (Timolol, except in Asthma),
- Topical alpha-2 agonists (apraclonidine, brimonidine) -> decreases production of aqueous + increases drainage.
#### Intravenous
- i.v. Acetazolamide: reduce secretions,
#### Others
- Steroids to reduce inflammation
- Anti-emetics

# Definitive treatment
After stabilizing, urgently refer to ophthalmologist  
peripheral iridotomy -> both eyes treated.
