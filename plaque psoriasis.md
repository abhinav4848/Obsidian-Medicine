## Treatment
### Initial
Topical corticosteroids (Betamethasone), 
Vit D analogues (**calcipotriol**), 
Should be applied separately, not at the same time. 
Continue for 8 weeks. 
### 2nd line after 8 weeks
Vit D analogue BD -> unlike steroid, this can be used long term, but avoid in pregnancy. 

no use of steroid here as we need 4 week break between steroids. 
### 3rd line after 8-12 weeks
Topical Steroid BD, Tar preparations.
Short acting Dithranol
## Secondary care
**Phototherapy**: UVB or (UVA + Psoralen)
**Systemic**: Oral Methotrexate, Ciclosporin, oral retinoids, 
**Biologics**: infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab
