*See [[Psoriasis]] for all other types*
Not to be confused with [[Actinic keratosis]].

---
# Aetiology 
- Has family history. 
- Can be triggered by stress/throat infections and can go away on its own. 
- Relapsing nature. 
- [[hla-b27|HLA-B27]], [[Ankylosing spondylitis]]
- Improves in sunny countries -> like Morocco (Sunlight has UVB)
- Starts as papules which later merge to form plaque. 

## Drugs causing Psoriasis 
ACE inhibitor, Alcohol, Anti-malarial (HCQ), [[beta adrenergic receptors|beta blockers]], Infliximab, [[Lithium]], Mepacrine, [[nsaid|NSAID]], Trauma. 

# Clinical Features
- Itchy, scaly, elevated, well demarcated, erythematous.
- On extensor surface (elbow, knees) & scalp (eczema is on flexures). 
- Auspitz's sign #named : Punctate bleeding when scales are scraped off. 
- New lesion at site of injury: [[Koebner's phenomenon]].
- Nail changes: Pitting/Onycholysis.

Based on shape: Plaque, [[Guttate psoriasis]] (oil drop)
# Treatment 
Regular [[emollients]] may help reduce scale loss & reduce itching
### Initial 
Combination of both
- Topical [[corticosteroid|corticosteroids]] (Betamethasone) OD, and
- Vit D analogues (**calcipotriol**) OD
Should be applied separately, not at the same time. 
Continue for 8 weeks. 

### 2nd line after 8 weeks
if no improvement after 8 weeks
- Vit D analogue BD -> unlike steroid, this can be used long term, but avoid in pregnancy. 
no use of steroid here as we need 4 week break between steroids. 
### 3rd line after 8-12 weeks
if no improvement:
- Potent topical Steroid BD for 4 weeks, or
- Tar preparations OD or BD
- Short acting Dithranol can also be used. 
## Secondary care
**Phototherapy**: UVB or (UVA + [[psoralen]])
**Systemic**: Oral Methotrexate, Ciclosporin, oral retinoids, 
**Biologics**: infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab

## Scalp Psoriasis
- potent topical steroid OD ([Betacap](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/3750/pil) 0.1%- Betametasone valerate, or better: Dovobet)
- If no improvement after 4 weeks then either use a different formulation of the potent corticosteroid (for example, a shampoo or mousse) and/or a topical agents to remove adherent scale (e.g. agents containing salicylic acid, emollients and oils) before application of the potent corticosteroid

## Face, flexural and genital psoriasis management
- NICE recommend offering a mild or moderate potency corticosteroid applied once or twice daily for a maximum of 2 weeks

# Notes on Medications
![[steroids in dermatology#Notes on topical steroids (is transcluded)]]

## Vitamin D analogues  
- examples of vitamin D analogues include calcipotriol (Dovonex), calcitriol and tacalcitol
- they work by ↓ cell division and differentiation → ↓ epidermal proliferation
- adverse effects are uncommon
- unlike corticosteroids they may be used long-term
- unlike coal tar and dithranol they do not smell or stain
- they tend to reduce the scale and thickness of plaques but not the erythema
- they should be avoided in pregnancy
- the maximum weekly amount for adults is 100g

## Dithranol
- inhibits DNA synthesis
- wash off after 30 mins
- adverse effects include burning, staining
## Coal tar 
- mechanism of action not fully understood - probably inhibit DNA synthesis
