Pityriasis rosea typically presents with a 
- **Herald patch**- Salmon coloured. Usually on trunk.
	#Mnemonic: *herald patch is a rose that grows into a tree*
- Followed by discrete, erythematous, oval, scaly patches which follow a characteristic distribution
	- longitudinal diameters of the oval lesions run parallel to lines of Langer. 
- Can produce a Christmas 'fir-tree'🌲appearance. 

*Herald patch: often mistaken for [[tinea corporis|Ringworm]]*
*Can even go to lower limbs.*
*Centrifugal distribution*

# Diff
- Patches are only mildly itchy (compared to [[discoid eczema]] which is very itchy) 
- Can be confused with [[Guttate psoriasis]] as it’s also discrete, but guttate is teardrop shaped, more scaly & often itchy.
# Treatment
Supportive management. 
Disappears after 6-7 weeks.
