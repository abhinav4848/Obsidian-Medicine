Pityriasis rosea typically presents with a 
- Herald patch (usually on trunk. #Mnemonic: herald patch is a rose that grows into a tree) 
- followed by discrete, erythematous, oval, scaly patches which follow a characteristic distribution with the longitudinal diameters of the oval lesions running parallel to the line of Langer. 
- This may produce a 'fir-tree' 🌲appearance. 

*Herald patch: often mistaken for ringworm*
*Can even go to lower limbs.*
*Centrifugal distribution*
# Diff
- Patches are only mildly itchy (compared to [[discoid eczema]] which is very itchy) 
- Can be confused with [[Guttate psoriasis]] as it’s also discrete, but guttate is teardrop shaped, more scaly & often itchy.
# Treatment
Supportive management. 
Disappears after 6-7 weeks.
