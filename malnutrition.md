NICE defines malnutrition as the following:  
- a Body Mass Index (BMI) of less than 18.5; or
- unintentional weight loss greater than 10% within the last 3-6 months; or
- a BMI of less than 20 and unintentional weight loss greater than 5% within the last 3-6 months

Use the MUST [[scoring system]] (malnutrition universal screen tool). 

# Management
- dietician support if the patient is at high-risk
- a 'food-first' approach with clear instructions (e.g. 'add full-fat cream to mashed potato'), rather than just prescribing oral nutritional supplements (ONS) such as Ensure/Fortisip/Nutrison energy
- if ONS are used they should be taken between meals, rather than instead of meals
