# Causes of small kidney
- Chronic pyelonephritis- history of repeated [[UTI]]s, stone, VUR -> renal scarring and [[hypertension]]. No proteinuria or [[haematuria]]. 
- Chronic glomerulonephritis- third leading cause of [[chronic kidney disease|CKD]]. 
- Bilateral renal artery stenosis
- Hypertensive nephropathy
