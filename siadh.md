  - Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion

# Causes:
- CNS: [[Meningitis]], Stroke, tumours
- Neoplasm: [[paraneoplastic syndrome|Small cell carcinoma of Lung]]
- Chest infections: Pneumonia, [[tuberculosis|TB]]
- **Drugs**: SSRI (Fluoxetine)

# Pathophysiology
- ADH high -> Water retention -> Vessel volume increased -> Aldosterone reduces -> Na excreted -> Water also lost with Na -> Body has euvolemic hyponatremia.
- Dilutional [[hyponatremia]]. Patient overhydrated
# Treatment
Fluid restriction > Tolvaptan/Demeclocycline

---
# Longer pathophysiology
1. ↑ ADH secretion → Water is drawn out of the urine
2. Water retention → ↓ serum osmolality with transient volume expansion → ↑ ANP, ↑ BNP, and ↓ aldosterone → ↑ urinary sodium and water excretion → euvolemic hyponatremia
3. Osmotic fluid shifts → cerebral edema and ↑ intracranial pressure (may occur in patients with extremely low Na+ levels)
