#### Notes from comments
- This is why it's so important they have anti-pyretics pre-and post immunizations, otherwise they end up on the paeds ward having an LP
- Oral antibiotics should not be prescribed to children with fever without apparent source. 
- if a [[pneumonia#10. Community Acquired Pneumonia is linked|pneumonia]] is suspected but the child is not going to be referred to hospital then a chest x-ray does not need to be routinely performed.
