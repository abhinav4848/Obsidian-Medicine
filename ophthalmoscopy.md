Inspect the macula by asking the patient to briefly look directly into the light of the ophthalmoscope. The macula is found lateral (temporal) to the optic nerve head and is yellow in colour. The central part of the macula, the “fovea” is about the same diameter as the optic disc and appears darker than the rest of the macula due to the presence of an additional pigment.

# Optic disc
![[cup disc ratio- 50 percent.png]]
- **Contour**: the borders of the optic disc should be clear and well defined. If the borders appear blurred it may suggest the presence of optic disc swelling (**papilledema**) secondary to raised intracranial pressure.
- **Colour**: a healthy optic disc should look like an orange-pink doughnut with a pale centre. The orange-pink colour represents well-perfused neuro-retinal tissue. A pale optic disc suggests the presence of optic atrophy which can occur as a result of [[optic neuritis]], advanced [[glaucoma- acute angle closure|acute angle glaucoma]] and ischaemic vascular events. ([[crao]]). 
- **Cup**: the cup is the pale centre of the orange-pink doughnut mentioned previously. The pale colour of the cup is due to the absence of neuro-retinal tissue. The vertical size of the cup can be estimated in relation to the optic disc as a whole, known as the “cup-to-disc ratio”. A cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 (i.e. the cup occupies one-third of the height of the optic disc) is generally considered normal. An increased ratio suggests reduced volume of healthy neuro-retinal tissue, which can occur in glaucoma. 

# Pathologies & Common Terms
- **Floaters**: #Mnemonic: CURD- CMV, [[Uveitis]], [[Retinal detachment]], DM retinopathy. 
- **Dot and blot haemorrhages**: arise from bleeding capillaries in the middle layers of the retina and may look like microaneurysms if small enough. They are most commonly associated with diabetic retinopathy. 
- **Flame shaped haemorrhage**: Larger haemorrhages with a flame-like appearance caused by rupture of pre-capillary arterioles or small veins in the retinal nerve fibre layer. Most commonly associated with grade 3 hypertensive retinopathy, thrombocytopaenia, retinal vein occlusion and trauma. e.g. [[crvo|CRVO]], diabetic, hypertensive. 
- **Cotton-wool spots**: caused by ischemia to the nerve fibre layer due to fibrinous necrosis and luminal narrowing -> decreased axoplasmic flow, nerve swelling, and ultimately fluffy opacification. Most commonly associated with diabetic retinopathy and grade 3 hypertensive retinopathy.
- **Exudates**: Waxy yellow lesions with relatively distinct margins arranged in clumps or rings, often surrounding leaking microaneurysms, as a result of lipid accumulation. They are most commonly associated with diabetic retinopathy and grade 3 [[retinopathy|hypertensive retinopathy]].
