# Optic disc
![[cup disc ratio- 50 percent.png]]
- **Contour**: the borders of the optic disc should be clear and well defined. If the borders appear blurred it may suggest the presence of optic disc swelling (papilledema) secondary to raised intracranial pressure.
- **Colour**: a healthy optic disc should look like an orange-pink doughnut with a pale centre. The orange-pink colour represents well-perfused neuro-retinal tissue. A pale optic disc suggests the presence of optic atrophy which can occur as a result of [[optic neuritis]], advanced [[glaucoma- acute angle closure|acute angle glaucoma]] and ischaemic vascular events. ([[crao]]). 
- **Cup**: the cup is the pale centre of the orange-pink doughnut mentioned previously. The pale colour of the cup is due to the absence of neuro-retinal tissue. The vertical size of the cup can be estimated in relation to the optic disc as a whole, known as the “cup-to-disc ratio”. A cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 (i.e. the cup occupies one-third of the height of the optic disc) is generally considered normal. An increased ratio suggests reduced volume of healthy neuro-retinal tissue, which can occur in glaucoma.
