# Tool to use
If no h/o #, use Fracture risk assessment tool. #named 
If h/o # or risk assessment > 10%, use DEXA (to obtain the T-score).
	If patient on alendronate, do DEXA 3-5 years.
	If stopped taking, do DEXA after 2 years

## T-Score understand and treatment
-1 or higher: Normal
-1 to -2.5: Osteopenia
	Rx: Lifestyle advice, Vit D, Calcium 1g/d, and DEXA after 2 years.
<= -2.5 (e.g.: -2.9), then osteoporosis.

# Calcium Supplementation
