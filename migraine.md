Pulsating/throbbing unilateral [[headache]] lasting up to 72 hrs. 
Migraine w/o aura is the MCC of primary headache in children.
Can be one side.
# Red Flag 🚩
**Atypical Aura:** Investigate for TIA #red_flag 
- \> 60 mins, motor weakness, double vision, visual symptoms affecting only one eye, or impaired balance 
- aura occurring for the first time in a person using [[COCP]]. 

However, prolonged aura without infarction can occur in rare cases of 
- familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), or 
- sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM), 
but these are very specific subtypes of migraines with additional diagnostic criteria beyond just prolonged aura duration.
