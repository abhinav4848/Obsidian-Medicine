Carotid artery stenosis: Multiple TIA + LOC
	Rx: see [[TIA]]

# Patients with AF + Ischemic TIA
Rx: [cardio](onenote:#Cardiology&section-id={145871C2-3C63-4A25-A087-79EA3E5CD53A}&page-id={1B7721F0-DA71-4DDC-915C-C8C35BFB0193}&object-id={B4645E4B-DEA9-491A-8ED7-FF4F8C185323}&7B&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/450c0e1b0b9c7922/Documents/Onenote/MBBS/PLAB.one)

If AF ✔:
- Aspirin 300mg for 2 weeks + DOAC for life (started 2 weeks late to prevent hemorrhagic transformation).

If no AF ❌:
- Aspirin 300mg for 2 weeks + Clopidogrel 75mg for life

No [[statins]] if hemorrhagic. 
- Delay starting statin for 48hrs due to risk of hemorrhagic transformation.

Patient already on Blood thinners/has bleeding disorder & TIA suspected
- Admit + CT head to exclude hemorrhagic

# Imaging
Do CT non-contrast as it's quicker than contrast CT
- Give stat Aspirin 300mg oral/rectal once hemorrhagic stroke is ruled out.

ROSIER score: -1 for LoC/Seizure.
# Management
# Acute
- If patient comes with CTA/MRA confirmed ischemic stroke, give alteplase thrombolysis (if <4.5 hrs) & thrombectomy (if <6hrs).
	- Or thrombectomy alone if <6hrs.
	- If last known to be well between 6 - 24 hrs previously (including wake-up strokes): Offer Thrombectomy if possibility of reversible ischemia.
- Thrombolysis is absolute c/I in [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|Pregnancy]].
- Carotid artery endarterectomy (Secondary prevention) can be considered if there is a stroke or TIA in the carotid territory, and the patient is not severely disabled.

## Non Acute in A&E/GP surgery:
- if patient comes with resolved TIA within 7 days: give 300mg Aspirin and refer for assessment within 24 hrs.
	- Haemorrhage does not need to ruled out as TIA is ischemic by definition
	- Advise no driving
- If TIA was more than 7 days ago, arrange specialist review within 7 days
- If >1 TIA (crescendo TIA), discuss admission with stroke specialist. 
- Suspected cardioembolic stroke?: immediate
