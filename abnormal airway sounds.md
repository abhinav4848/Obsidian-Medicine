# Wheezing
Whistling Sound -> Narrow Airways -> Heard in Expiration

# Grunting
Exhaling With Glottis Partially Closed -> Done because the body wants to Increase Positive End-expiratory pressure in order to maintain airways that want to collapse. Admit to hospital. Eg: [[bronchiolitis (lrti)]] (LRTI)

# Stridor
High Pitched Inspiratory noise (like whistling)
Obstruction of Upper Airway -> E.g. [[Croup]]

**Inspiratory stridor**: Pathology is extra-thoracic (Laryngeal obstruction)
**Expiratory stridor**: Pathology is intrathoracic (below trachea)

Croup has features of both but since larynx mostly involved -> Inspiratory more common
