Based on area of obstruction, we get the sound

|        | Upper airway                                                     | Lower Airway                                                             |

# Stridor 
- Due to narrowing in the upper airway. 
	- E.g. [[Croup]], [[acute epiglottitis]], [[pertussis]]. 
- Can be heard from across the room. 
- Higher Pitched Inspiratory noise (like whistling). 

**Inspiratory stridor**: Pathology is extra-thoracic/above vocal cords (Laryngeal obstruction)
**Expiratory stridor**: Pathology is intrathoracic/below vocal cords (below trachea)

Can be biphasic- Croup has features of both but since larynx mostly involved -> Inspiratory more common

# Wheezing
Whistling Sound -> Narrow Airways -> Heard in Expiration

# Grunting
- Exhaling With Glottis Partially Closed -> Done because the body wants to increase Positive End-expiratory pressure in order to maintain airways that want to collapse. 
- Admit to hospital. 
- Seen more in LRTI conditions like [[bronchiolitis]].
