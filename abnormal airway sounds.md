Wheezing -> Whistling Sound -> Narrow Airways -> Heard in Expiration

Grunting -> Exhaling With Glottis Partially Closed -> Done because the body wants to Increase Positive End-expiratory pressure in order to maintain airways that want to collapse. Admit to hospital. Eg: [[bronchiolitis (lrti)]] (LRTI)

Stridor -> High Pitched Inspiratory noise (like whistling) -> Obstruction Upper Airway -> E.g. [[Croup]]
