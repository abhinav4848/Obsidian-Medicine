# Aetiology
While individuals living continuously in endemic areas can develop a certain level of immunity, this wanes quickly once they leave these areas, so UK individuals don't have better immunity to malaria. 
Approx 1500-2000 cases seen each year. 
Most malarias happen due to poor prophylaxis. 
94% of global malaria deaths happen in sub-Saharan Africa. 
75% of cases are by plasmodium falciparum. 

# Clinical Features
h/o [[travel infections|travel]] to Africa + meningitis like features + anaemia -> Cerebral malaria.

# Management
## Prophylaxis

If Schuffner's dots #named -> latent hypnozoites in liver -> Primaquine (targets all stages)
For non-falciparum, non-hypnozoite malaria -> Chloroquine > [[quinine]] (target active stage)
## Pregnancy
Primaquine is [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|c/i in pregnancy]] & breastfeeding. 
Chloroquine & Proguanil safe in pregnancy but no longer effective in chloroquine-resistant areas.
Mefloquine is now the DOC for Pregnants as prophylaxis in T2&T3 when travelling to chloroquine resistant areas.
## G6PD
Primaquine is c/i
