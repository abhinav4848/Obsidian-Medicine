# Aetiology
- While individuals living continuously in endemic areas can develop a certain level of immunity, this wanes quickly once they leave these areas, so UK individuals don't have better immunity to malaria. 
- Approx 1500-2000 cases seen each year. 
- Most malarias happen due to poor prophylaxis. 
- 94% of global malaria deaths happen in sub-Saharan Africa. 
- 75% of cases are by plasmodium falciparum. 
# Clinical Features
h/o [[travel infections|travel]] to Africa + meningitis like features + anaemia -> Cerebral malaria (rather than viral [[encephalitis]])
# Management
## Prophylaxis
| **Drug**                          | **Side-effects + notes**                                                                                 | **Time to begin before travel** | **Time to end after travel** |

If Schuffner's dots #named -> latent hypnozoites in liver -> Primaquine (targets all stages)
For non-falciparum, non-hypnozoite malaria -> Chloroquine > [[quinine]] (target active stage)
## Pregnancy
Advise not to travel to endemic regions. 
Diagnosis can be made difficult due to placental sequestration of parasites, thus not detectable in blood. 
However, if travel can't be avoided:
- Chloroquine & Proguanil safe in pregnancy but no longer effective in chloroquine-resistant areas. Proguanil needs [[folic acid]] supplementation. 
- Mefloquine is now the DOC for Pregnant as prophylaxis in T2&T3 when travelling to chloroquine resistant areas. Caution advised. 
- Malarone (atovaquone + proguanil): the BNF advises to avoid these drugs unless essential. If taken then folate supplementation should be given
#### Contraindicated in pregnancy
- Doxycycline contraindicated. 
- Primaquine is [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|c/i in pregnancy]] & breastfeeding. 
## Children
Children are more at risk of severe complication so avoid travel, but if needed:
- DEET (di-ethyl-toluamide) 20-50%: Repels 100% of mosquitoes if used correctly. Can be used in 
	- children > 2 months old
	- breastfeeding & pregnant women in T2/T3. 
- Doxycycline is only licensed for children > 12 years age. 
## G6PD
Primaquine is c/i
