Degenerative condition of hip joints in [[limping child|children]] aged 3 - 9 years. (more common in boys & 10% cases are b/l)

Leads to avascular necrosis of femur epiphysis.
Chronic disease. 

>[!notice]
>A limping child (aged 4–6 years) with hip pain, persisting for more than 2 weeks, should be examined and investigated to rule out Perthes disease.
# Clinical features
Chronic pain: Hip & groin pain, progresses over weeks, months.
[[limping child]]. 
Stiffness, decreased range of hip movement (as loss of head surface)- *limited internal rotation and abduction.*
# X-ray 
**Initially**:
- Widening of joint space,

**Later**:
- Decreased femoral head size,
- Flattening (coxa plana)
- Sclerosis,
- Radiolucency of proximal metaphysis. 

# Treatment
Conservative. 
Over time, the blood supply to the head of the femur returns and the bone begins to grow back.
