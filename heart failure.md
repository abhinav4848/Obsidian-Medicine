# Investigation
If suspected Heart Failure, Check NT-pro BNP level
- If >2000 → specialist assessment and echo within 2 weeks
- If 400-2000 → specialist assessment and echo within 6 weeks
- <400 → consider alternatives

## Reasons for high Natriuretic peptide include
- **Cardiac**: LVH, myocardial ischemia, tachycardia, right ventricular overload, pulmonary hypertension
- **Other**: Age > 70, PE, hypoxia, sepsis, CKD, Liver cirrhosis
Low EF: Treatment with [[ace inhibitors|ACE inhibitor]], ARB, Beta blockers, as well as obesity can falsely lower BNP

# Classification
## Reduced EF: (aka Systolic heart failure)
HFrEF
Problems with LV & pressures go backwards -> Lung features, Pulmonary edema & Breathlessness
if severe, then RV features as well -> Fluid overload + Peripheral edema

## Preserved EF: (aka diastolic heart failure)
HFpEF
Problems with RV due to non-compliance -> Dyspnoea w/o signs of fluid overload

---
# Management
## Primary care
**Reduced EF**: ACE-i and beta-blocker (start one at time)
**Preserved EF**: Evidence not specific on NICE CKS - specialist advice
## Secondary care
**Medical**: aldosterone, digoxin, hydralazine, ivabradine (selectively inhibits funny current in the sinus node to slow sinus rhythm)

**Interventional**: Cardiac resynchronisation therapy, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), Coronary revascularization, Cardiac transplantation.
### End-stage heart failure:
- i.e. at high risk of dying within next 6-12 months
- Potentially increased symptoms, poorer response to treatment
- Multiple inputs eg cardiology, heart failure nurses, community nurses, palliative care nurses, physiotherapy, dietician etc

# DRUGS
NICE: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng106
[Chronic Heart failure 2025 Flowchart](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng106/resources/chronic-heart-failure-core-treatments-for-heart-failure-pdf-6663137725) 
Monitor U&E with these drugs

## HFrEF
### 1st line
- ACE inhibitor
	- if ACEi note tolerated (cough) -> Give ARNI (Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor) Sacubitril/Valsartan -> if EF < 35% (Specialist assessment) 
	- If angioedema develops with ACE or ARNI -> Switch to ARB
- Beta Blocker
	- Both ACEi & [[beta adrenergic receptors|BB]] (Metoprolol, Bisoprolol, Carvedilol) reduce mortality by reducing afterload.
- MRA
	- Spironolactone. Monitor K+ & renal function (eGFR) as both ACEi & MRA (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) cause [[hyperkalemia]]. Spironolactone reduces the instance of sudden cardiac death and should be offered to any patient who has LV systolic dysfunction following MI.
- SGLT2 inhibitor
	- Dapagliflozin: Reduces hospitalization secondary to heart failure & Cardiovascular death.
### 2nd Line
Second-line treatment should be initiated by a specialist. Options include ivabradine, hydralazine in combination with nitrate, digoxin and cardiac resynchronisation therapy  
- Ivabradine
    - criteria: sinus rhythm > 75/min and a left ventricular fraction < 35%
- [[Digoxin]]
    - digoxin has also not been proven to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure. It may however improve symptoms due to its inotropic properties
    - it is strongly indicated if there is coexistent [[atrial fibrillation]] or worsening HF due to LVSD
- Hydralazine + nitrate
	- Used if intolerance to ACE/ARNI/ARB
    - this may be particularly indicated in [[afro-caribbean|Afro-Caribbean]] patients
- Cardiac resynchronisation therapy
    - indications include a widened QRS (e.g. left bundle branch block) complex on ECG

Loop diuretic have symptomatic benefit (congestive symptoms and fluid retention) but **don’t change mortality**.
Amiloride (Direct inhibitor of Na+ channel, K+ sparing) is also **symptomatic benefit only**.
Digoxin doesn't affect mortality. 

Avoid verapamil, diltiazem and short-acting dihydropyridine agents in people who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

## HFpEF
MRA & SGLT2 inhibitors
## Other treatments %%linked%%
- offer annual influenza vaccine (same as [[copd- treatment]]). 
- offer one-off pneumococcal vaccine 
	- Adults usually require just one dose but those with asplenia, splenic dysfunction or chronic kidney disease need a booster every 5 years
- Assess for iron deficiency  
	- check transferrin saturation (TSAT), ferritin, haemoglobin
	- consider IV iron therapy if haemoglobin < 150 g/L and
	    - TSAT of less than 20% or
	    - serum ferritin of less than 100 ng/mL
	- if iron-deficiency is found, other causes should of course be excluded first (e.g. colonoscopy etc)
