# Investigation
If suspected Heart Failure, Check NT-pro BNP level
- If >2000 → specialist assessment and echo within 2 weeks
- If 400-2000 → specialist assessment and echo within 6 weeks
- <400 → consider alternatives

## Reasons for high Natriuretic peptide include
- **Cardiac**: LVH, myocardial ischemia, tachycardia, right ventricular overload, pulmonary hypertension
- **Other**: Age > 70, PE, hypoxia, sepsis, CKD, Liver cirrhosis
Low EF: Treatment with [[ace inhibitors|ACE inhibitor]], ARB, Beta blockers, as well as obesity can falsely lower BNP

# Classification
## Reduced EF: (aka Systolic heart failure)
HFrEF
Problems with LV & pressures go backwards -> Lung features, Pulmonary edema & Breathlessness
if severe, then RV features as well -> Fluid overload + Peripheral edema

## Preserved EF: (aka diastolic heart failure)
HFpEF
Problems with RV due to non-compliance -> Dyspnoea w/o signs of fluid overload

---
# Management
## Primary care
**Reduced EF**: ACE-i and beta-blocker (start one at time)
**Preserved EF**: Evidence not specific on NICE CKS - specialist advice
## Secondary care
**Medical**: aldosterone, digoxin, hydralazine, ivabradine (selectively inhibits funny current in the sinus node to slow sinus rhythm)

**Interventional**: Cardiac resynchronisation therapy, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), Coronary revascularization, Cardiac transplantation.
### End-stage heart failure:
- i.e. at high risk of dying within next 6-12 months
- Potentially increased symptoms, poorer response to treatment
- Multiple inputs eg cardiology, heart failure nurses, community nurses, palliative care nurses, physiotherapy, dietician etc

# DRUGS
NICE: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng106
## 1st line
Both ACEi & BB (Metoprolol, Bisoprolol, Carvedilol) are first line & reduce mortality by reducing afterload.
- if intolerant of ACEi -> Give ARB instead.
## 2nd Line
If still no control, add MRA.
- Spironolactone. Monitor K+ & renal function (eGFR) as both ACEi & MRA (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) cause [[hyperkalemia]]. Spironolactone reduces the instance of sudden cardiac death and should be offered to any patient who has LV systolic dysfunction following MI.

if intolerant to ACEi & ARB -> Hydralazine & Nitrate

Dapagliflozin (SGLT-2 inhibitor)
- reduces hospitalization secondary to heart failure & Cardiovascular death. (not yet in the NICE pathway).

## 3rd Line:
- Replace ACEi (or ARB) with Sacubitril/Valsartan if EF < 35%
- Add Ivabradine for Sinus rhythm with HR > 75 & EF <35%
- Add Hydralazine & Nitrate esp. if [[afro-caribbean|Afro-Caribbean]].
- [[Digoxin]] can be given for HF + AF, or worsening HF due to LVSD despite using 1st & 2nd line. It increases mortality in cardiac patients.

Loop diuretic have symptomatic benefit (congestive symptoms and fluid retention) but **don’t change mortality**.
Amiloride (Direct inhibitor of Na+ channel, K+ sparing) is also **symptomatic benefit only**.

Avoid verapamil, diltiazem and short-acting dihydropyridine agents in people who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

## Other treatments
- offer annual influenza vaccine (same as [[copd- treatment]]). 
- offer one-off pneumococcal vaccine 
	- Adults usually require just one dose but those with asplenia, splenic dysfunction or chronic kidney disease need a booster every 5 years
