| Circumstantiality     | similar to tangentiality but the patient, after giving excessive details, eventually returns to the topic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Clang                 | Rhyming sound                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Derailment            | derailing may be talking about feelings, then sadness then saying how sad the current pandemic situation is, and then talking about viruses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Flight of Ideas       | It's characterised by rapid speech with frequent changes in topics based on associations, distractions or word play. Flight of ideas involves thoughts abruptly jumping from topic to topic. The thoughts are linked somehow, although sometimes minimally and often by clanging (linking similar sounding words), punning or rhyming.<br><br>Seen in [[Mania]]. |
| Knights move thinking | (also known as loosening of associations or derailment) is similar to flight of ideas, but there is no apparent link between topics. It is called 'knights move' thinking because there is no clear link, the train of thoughts are not linear, like the knight in a game of chess; the train of thought jumps illogically to another topic.                     |
| Preservation          | repetition of words, ideas of thoughts even when the topic is changed, e.g. 'What's your name?' 'John'. 'Where were you born?' 'John'. 'Where are we now?' 'John'.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Pressured speech      | Speaking fast                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Psychosis             | delusions of grandeur, auditory hallucinations, etc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Tangentiality         | Tangentiality is where the patient veers off topic and never answers the initial question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
