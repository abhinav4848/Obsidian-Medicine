# Causes
Gastric atrophy (2nd to [[H. pylori]]), Gastrectomy, Malnutrition (alcohol).
- Parietal cells are attacked in pernicious anaemia. So no Intrinsic factor. No HCl.
# Associated 
with other #autoimmune disorders:
- Thyroid disease, T1DM, Addison's, Rheumatoid and vitiligo
- Leads to increased risk of [[cancer- gastric|gastric cancer]]. 

# Clinical Features
- Anaemia- lethargy, pallor, dyspnoea
- Neurological- peripheral neuropathy (pins and needles), symmetrical, legs more than arms
- SACD of spinal cord- progressive weakness, ataxia, paresthesia, progress to spasticity, paraplegia
- Neuropsychiatric: memory loss, poor concentration, confusion, depression, irritability
- Others: Mild jaundice (combined with pallor gives lemon tinge), atrophic glossitis (sore tongue)

# Investigations
**Antibodies**: Intrinsic factor antibodies are better than Gastric parietal cell Ab. IF antibodies are specific but only present in 50-60% cases. A positive result is therefore, not necessary for a diagnosis. 

A schilling test involves administering radiolabelled B12. Given that artificial B12 replacement is now widely available it is generally no longer needed.

# Treatment
IM B12
- no neurological features: 3 injections per week for 2 weeks followed by 3 monthly treatment of vitamin B12 injections
- more frequent doses are given for patients with neurological features
[[Folic acid]] supplementation

## B12
Homocysteine is a risk factor for heart disease.
