ADH dysfunction -> excess water loss in urine and Hypernatremia 145mEq/L.
Normal Urine osmolality < 800 mOsm/L

Defined as "the passage of large volumes (>3 L/24 hr.) of dilute urine (< 300 mOsm/kg)".
Dilute urine = Low Osmolality Urine.
# Types:
## Cranial
Low ADH Production. Responds to Desmopressin (e.g. [[Sarcoidosis]] -> Infective process of hypothalamus)
## Nephrogenic
Kidney resistant to ADH. (e.g. Lithium, Hypercalcemia, Hypokalemia) -> eg:
### Hypokalemia
Low K+ can cause Na+/2Cl/K+ pump to fail so Na+ not reabsorbed -> Urine Na loss & polyuria.

# C/F
Polyuria, extreme thirst & polydipsia, dehydration
Symptoms of [[Hypernatremia]].
High serum osmolality, Low urine osmolality,
	Urine osmolality increases after vasopressin: central DI
	no change after vasopressin: Nephrogenic DI
If thirst response is intact in cranial DI, then patient increases their fluid intake, else (patient unconscious/has intracerebral lesion making them adipsic), they can get dehydrated

# Investigation
Fluid restriction to differentiate DI from Psychogenic polydipsia
-> If still urinating high volumes and urine osmolality is still low
	-> it is DI
	-> Give Desmopressin (DDAVP) for differentiating Central/Nephrogenic DI.
-> if urine output reduced, it's psychogenic.

## Urine osmolality (mOsm/Kg)

| Test                    | Central DI | Nephrogenic DI |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| After fluid deprivation | <300       | <300           |
| After desmopressin      | >800       | <300           |

## In [[siadh|SIADH]]:
#confusion 
[[Hyponatremia]] (low Serum Sodium), No [[hyperkalemia]].
Low Serum Osmolality. High Urine Osmolality.
Happens due to Cerebrum/cerebellum.

## In Diabetes Insipidus:
[[Hypernatremia]] (high serum sodium), .
High Serum Osmolality, Low Urine Osmolality.
Happens due to diencephalon.
