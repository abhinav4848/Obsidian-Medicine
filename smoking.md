- Bupropion: Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and nicotinic acetylcholine antagonist.
- Verenicline: Nicotinic receptor partial agonist. Varenicline works by partially activating the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, reducing cravings for nicotine and withdrawal symptoms.

Do not offer NRT (nicotine replacement therapy), varenicline or bupropion in any combination.

Varenicline and bupropion are contraindicated.
