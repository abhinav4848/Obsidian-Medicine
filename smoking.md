Smoking increases risk for [[cancer- urology|bladder cancer]] & laryngeal cancer. 
# NICE guidelines
[NICE](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/smoking-cessation/management/adults/) 
NRT, varenicline or bupropion should not be favoured one over the other. 
They should be given as part of a plan to stop smoking on or before a particular date. 
- supply should last until 2 weeks after target stopping date. 
- if giving NRT, choose target date 2 weeks after starting NRT, else with others, choose 3-4 weeks. 
- further prescription only if quit attempt continuing. 
- if not successful with them, don't repeat prescription for 6 months. 
- Do not offer NRT (nicotine replacement therapy), varenicline or bupropion in any combination with one another. 
## Quitting date

| Treatment   | When to start              | Supply    |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| NRT         | On the quit date           | 2 weeks   |
| Varenicline | 1 week before quit date    | 3-4 weeks |
| Bupropion   | 1-2 weeks before quit date | 3-4 weeks |

# NRT
- can cause N&V, headache, flu-like symptoms. 
- NICE recommends combos of nicotine patch with another form of NRT (gum/inhalator/lozenge/nasal spray) to those with high dependence & where NRT background wasn't enough & they're having breakthrough urges. 
- NRT patches should be used for no more than 16 hours in any 24-hour period. The best way to stick to this is to remove the patch at bedtime. Nicotine is a stimulant, and if the patch is worn at night, it may cause insomnia or abnormal dreams.
- there is now a 24 hour NRT patch that is recommended by CKS if smoking cravings are worst in the morning
- NRT can be started on the Quit day

# Varenicline
Nicotinic receptor partial agonist. More effective than bupropion. 
Varenicline works by partially activating the *nicotinic acetylcholine receptor*, reducing cravings for nicotine and withdrawal symptoms.
- Start 1 week before the target stop date. 
- recommended course of treatment is 12 weeks. Only continue treatment at any point if patient not smoking. 
- use with caution if h/o depression/self-harm. 
- c/i in [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|pregnancy]] & breastfeeding. 
# Bupropion
Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and nicotinic acetylcholine antagonist.
Unlike many [[depression|antidepressants]], it has minimal effect on serotonin. 
- Start 1-2 weeks before target date to stop. 
- small risk of seizures (1 in 1000)
- c/i in [[epilepsy]], [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|pregnancy]], breastfeeding. 
- Having an eating disorder is a relative contraindication.

# Pregnancy
Smoking during pregnancy reduces birthweight. 

NICE recommended in 2010 that all pregnant women should be tested for smoking using carbon monoxide detectors, partly because _'some women find it difficult to say that they smoke because the pressure not to smoke during pregnancy is so intense.'_. All women who smoke, or have stopped smoking within the last 2 weeks, or those with a CO reading of 7 ppm or above should be referred to NHS Stop Smoking Services.  
## Interventions  
- the first-line interventions in pregnancy should be 
	- cognitive behaviour therapy, 
	- motivational interviewing or 
	- structured self-help and 
	- support from NHS Stop Smoking Services
- the evidence for the use of NRT in pregnancy is mixed but it is often used if the above measures failure. There is no evidence that it affects the child's birthweight. **Pregnant women should remove the patches before going to bed**
- Varenicline and bupropion are contraindicated
