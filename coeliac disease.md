Inability to tolerate gliadin, the alcohol soluble fraction of gluten that confers viscosity. Repeated exposure leads to villous atrophy -> malabsorption. 
# Clinical Features
- Bloating
- Abdo pain (cramping or distension)
- [[Diarrhoea]] (fatty, grey-frothy stools)
- low B9 (B9 > B12)
- IDA
# Associations
#associated 
1. Coeliac can cause: **T-cell lymphoma** (as T-cells get activated by gluten exposure).  #cancer  
2. Dermatitis Herpetiformis [Dermnetz](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatitis-herpetiformis)(Cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease. Nothing to do with herpes. It's pruritic vesicles on [[confusion in skin lesions|extensors]]. Give Dapsone) 
3.  f/h/o Autoimmune disorders (type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune hepatitis, thyroid). 
4. Iron deficiency due to malabsorption. 
5. Hyposplenism
6. [[osteoporosis]], Osteomalacia

# Test for antibody
Eat gluten for at least 6 weeks before being tested. Else Gluten-free diet can result false negative results. This is important because if patient doesn't have coeliac, it'll be quite restrictive to their lifestyle to avoid gluten for no reason.

tTG- IgA (test of choice)
+
Absolute IgA: Needed to look for selective IgA deficiency, which would give a false-negative coeliac result. Some patients have low IgA so for all patients, also do absolute IgA count to rule out Celiac with low IgA. 

if there is confirmed IgA deficiency but coeliac still suspected, test for: 
- IgG endomyseal antibodies (EMA), 
- IgG deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP)
	- Donâ€™t do just anti-gliadin (IgA or IgG) because antibodies against **deamidated** gliadin peptides are more immunogenic than native gliadin. Gliadin gets deaminated inside intestinal wall by tTG. 
- IgG transglutaminase antibodies

Patient would need to do duodenal biopsy (as coeliac affects duodenum & proximal jejunum) for histological confirmation- Gold standard for diagnosis.
