# Treatment
**All P's** #mnemonic 
Symptomatic treatment
	Paracetamol
Beta blocker (propranolol oral/iv) for A Fib & palpitations
	It's recommended even in normal A Fib. Not just in thyroid storm.

Propylthiouracil (PTU)
	Used over Carbimazole cuz it inhibits peripheral conversion faster
	Preferred in Preconception, T1, Post-partum
	If no thyroid storm or pregnancy, Carbimazole is first line.
High dose steroids (Prednisolone) inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3
Lugol's Iodine (potassium iodide)
	inhibits release of thyroid hormones

Cooling.
Broad spectrum antibiotics.
	Iv co-amoxiclav if the cause was infection.
