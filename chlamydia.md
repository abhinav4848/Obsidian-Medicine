Most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the UK.
1. [[gynaecological infections|cervicitis]], Salpingitis: Painless ulcer, vaginal discharge, post-coital bleed, red & inflamed vulva, cervix, tender pelvis but non-tender abdomen.
2. Epididymitis (in both)
## 3 stages.
1. Small painless pustule which later turns to an ulcer
2. Painful inguinal LNE
3. Procto-Colitis
# Potential complications
- epididymitis
- [[gynaecological infections#Pelvic Inflammatory disease|pelvic inflammatory disease]]
- [[gynaecological discharges|Endometritis]]
- increased incidence of ectopic pregnancies
- infertility
- [[reactive arthritis]]
- perihepatitis ([[fitz-hugh-curtis syndrome]])
- [[Erythema nodosum]]

# Chlamydia/[[gonorrhoea]] if untreated
Males: Epididymo-orchitis/Epididymitis -> U/l testicular pain
Females: Salpingitis

# Management (y for y)
- doxycycline (7 day course) if first-line (also 1st line in [[lyme disease]])
	- this is now preferred to azithromycin due to concerns about Mycoplasma genitalium. This infection is often co-existent in patients with Chlamydia and there is evidence of rising levels of macrolide resistance, hence why doxycycline is preferred. #abx 
	- if doxycycline is contraindicated / not tolerated then azithromycin (1g OD for one day, then 500mg OD for two days) should be used
- if pregnant then azithromycin, erythromycin or amoxicillin may be used. The SIGN guidelines suggest azithromycin 1g stat is the drug of choice 'following discussion of the balance of benefits and risks with the patient'

## Contacts
- patients diagnosed with Chlamydia should be offered a choice of provider for initial partner notification - either trained practice nurses with support from GUM, or referral to GUM
- for men with urethral symptoms: all contacts since, and in the four weeks prior to, the onset of symptoms
- for women and asymptomatic men all partners from the last six months or the most recent sexual partner should be contacted
- contacts of confirmed Chlamydia cases should be offered treatment prior to the results of their investigations being known (treat then test)
