# NIPE: NHS Newborn & Infant Physical Examination.

If the NIPE **newborn** screening examination is screen negative, (no abnormality suspected), the NIPE **infant** screening examination should be performed at 6-8 weeks of age. 

If the NIPE **infant** screening examination is screen negative, (no abnormalities suspected), care should follow the [Healthy Child Program](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/healthy-child-programme).
