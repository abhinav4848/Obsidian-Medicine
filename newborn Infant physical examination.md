# NIPE: Newborn & Infant Physical Examination.
This goes step by step. If one is negative (no abnormality detected), go to next: 
1. NIPE newborn screening examination
2. NIPE infant screening examination (6-8 weeks old)
3. Care should follow the [Healthy Child Program](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/healthy-child-programme).
