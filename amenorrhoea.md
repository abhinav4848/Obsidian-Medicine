2ry amenorrhea (cessation of menstruation for > 6 months after it has been established)
# Hypothalamic amenorrhea
Secondary Amenorrhea that occurs with stress, excessive exercise (e.g. a runner, a sports lady) or significantly low BMI

In hypothalamic failure ->
- decreased GnRH -> decreased FSH, LH (with often subsequent decreased oestrogen).
- High Prolactin

# Amenorrhea due to Hypothyroidism
In [[Hypothyroidism]], initially, there's menorrhagia -> Oligomenorrhea -> Amenorrhea. 

# Misc causes
