# Assess Severity of asthma attack
Determine the severity of asthma exacerbation by: Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) using Peak flow meter.
- Moderate: 50-75%
- Acute severe: 33-50%
- Life threat: <33%

ABG is done in A&E to know O2 sats. 

# Life threatening features
- Altered mental status with drowsiness.
- Silent Chest (Absent chest sounds)
- Poor respiratory effort.
- Exhaustion.
- Cyanosis.
- Arrhythmia.
- Hypotension.
- PEFR < 33% predicted or best.
- SpO2 < 92%.
- PaO2 < 8 kPa.
- PaCO2 is normal (4.6-6 kPa)
