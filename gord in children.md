Develops before 8 weeks. 
# Treat 
- Position during feeds: 30 degrees head up.
- infant to sleep on their back to prevent cot death
- do not overfeed and give small frequent feeds:
	- A formula fed infant with GORD should have feeds reduced to 150ml/kg per day (6-8 hrs.).
- try thickened formula
- try alginate therapy
- Try PPI only if:
	- unexplained feeding difficulties (for example, refusing feeds, gagging or choking)
	- distressed behaviour
	- faltering growth

Offering a trial of feed thickeners or alginate therapy added to formula are both options in NICE's stepped care approach that can be trialled if reducing the volume of feeds and ensuring feeds are small and frequent have not improved symptoms significantly.

>There is emerging evidence that infant overfeeding alters epigenetic expression, meaning these kids have the deck stacked against them in maintaining a healthy BMI for life. 

# Safety Net in GOR
GOR (physiological in infancy) is different from GORD. 

When reassuring parents and carers about regurgitation, advise them that they should return for review if any of the following occur:
- the regurgitation becomes persistently projectile
- there is bile‑stained (green or yellow‑green) vomiting or haematemesis (blood in vomit)
- there are new concerns, such as signs of marked distress, feeding difficulties or faltering growth
- there is persistent, frequent regurgitation beyond the first year of life.

Onset of regurgitation and/or vomiting after 6 months old or persisting after 1 year old- Late onset suggests a cause other than reflux, for example a urinary tract infection (NICE: [UTI in <16yo](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng224/chapter/Recommendations#diagnosis))
