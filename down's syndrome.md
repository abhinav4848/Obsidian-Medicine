# Screening in Pregnancy
Down syndrome screening can be divided into the different screening tests available for patients:  

| Test                   | Dates Available                                 | What is tested?                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Combined / Triple Test | 10 weeks + 0 days to 14 weeks + 1-day gestation | NT, free βhCG and PAPP-A                            |
| Quadruple Test         | 14 weeks + 2 days to 20 weeks gestation         | αFP, free βhCG, inhibin-A, oestriol                 |
| Integrated Test        | 10 weeks + 0 days to 20 weeks gestation         | NT, free βhCG, PAPP-A, <br>AFP, inhibin-A, oestriol |
- NT: Ultrasound Nuchal Translucency (NT) measurement
- αFP: alpha-fetoprotein
- PAPP-A: pregnancy-associated plasma protein A
- Oestriol: unconjugated oestriol

| **Edward's syndrome**   | ↓                 | ↓                     | ↓                             | ↔         |
| **Neural tube defects** | ↑                 | ↔                     | ↔                             | ↔         |
### Results of combined or quadruple tests
Results of the screening test are expressed as a ratio. 

The NHS Fetal Anomaly Screening Program categorise the results into two categories. Both the combined and quadruple tests return either a 'lower chance' or 'higher chance' result.

|                         |                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lower risk results**  | Risk lower than 1:150 (the second number is higher than 150, e.g. 1 in 300) | Over 95% of test results will show a lower risk result. A lower-risk result does not mean that the baby definitely does not have Down syndrome. About 15% of babies with Down syndrome are not detected by screening tests. If a patient has a lower risk result they will not be offered a further test for Down syndrome. |
| **Higher risk results** | Risk above 1:150 (between 1 in 2 to 1 in 150,e.g. 1 in 100)                 | This does not mean the baby definitely has Down syndrome. If the patient has a higher risk result they will be offered a diagnostic test to find out whether their baby has Down syndrome or not. It is the patient's choice whether or not to have the further test.                                                       |
#### Non-invasive prenatal screening test (NIPT)
If a woman has a 'higher chance' results she will be offered a second screening test (NIPT) or a diagnostic test (e.g. amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS)). Given the non-invasive nature of NIPT and extremely high sensitivity and specificity, it is likely this will be the preferred choice for the vast majority of women.  
  
NIPT 
- analyses small DNA fragments that circulate in the blood of a pregnant woman (cell free fetal DNA, cffDNA)
- cffDNA derives from placental cells and is usually identical to fetal DNA
- analysis of cffDNA allows for the early detection of certain chromosomal abnormalities
- sensitivity and specificity are very high for trisomy 21 (>99%) and similarly high for other chromosomal abnormalities
- private companies (e.g. Harmony) offer NIPT screening from 10 weeks gestation
