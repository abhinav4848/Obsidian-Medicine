*See [[contraceptives for bleeding reduction]].*
# COCP
See [[cocp|COCP]]. 

# Depo Provera 
Depo-Provera (POI -> injection. Aka DMPA): IM medroxyprogesterone acetate.
- c/I in <20 yo cuz risk of [[osteoporosis]].
	- Has concerns for bone mineral density with long term use & delay in return to fertility. 
- Unpredictable effects on bleeding patterns. 
- Intermenstrual spotting in first year of starting. If bothersome bleed -> add COCP 3 months/Mefenamic acid TDS 5 days (while still on Depo-Provera).
- Give once every 3 months.
- Completely stops the period in some women but can cause unpredictable bleeding in others. 
# Intrauterine devices
- *See [[contraceptives in emergency|Emergency contraception]].* 
c/I in < 20 yo
Use < 48 hrs or > 28 days after delivery. Else risk of perforation in between.
Has no absolute risk of ectopic pregnancy, but has relative risk.
### IUS (Mirena)
Mirena (LNG-IUS)
- It contains levonorgestrel (progesterone)
- It prevents endometrial proliferation (reducing blood loss by >90%) & thickens cervical mucus.
- IUS alleviates symptoms of Endometriosis, Adenomyosis, Fibroids.
- IUS is a major risk factor for PID (Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea).
- Has lowest failure rate (even less than lap tubal sterilization). 
- Can have initial irregular bleed but should settle by 3-6 months. 
- The proportion of pregnancies that are ectopic is increased but the absolute number of ectopic pregnancies is reduced, compared to a woman not using contraception. 
	- If a woman is using contraception, she has fewer pregnancies overall.  
	- Among those pregnancies that _do_ happen, a slightly higher fraction might be ectopic.
##### Validity
- Mirena is licensed for 8 years (or until age 55 if fitted after age 45)
- if used as endometrial protection for women taking oestrogen-only [[hrt|Hormone Replacement Therapy]] they are only licensed for 5 years
### IUD (Copper-T)
- Cu-T decreases sperm motility and survival.
- Copper IUDs typically make periods heavier, longer and more painful
