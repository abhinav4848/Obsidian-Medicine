# COCP
See [[cocp|COCP]]. 

# Depo Provera
Depo-Provera (POI -> injection. Aka DMPA): IM medroxyprogesterone acetate.
- c/I in <20 yo cuz risk of osteoporosis.
- Intermenstrual spotting in first year of starting. If bothersome bleed -> add COCP 3 months/Mefenamic acid TDS 5 days (while still on Depo-Provera)
- Give once every 3 months.

# Intrauterine devices
c/I in < 20 yo
Use < 48 hrs or > 28 days after delivery. Else risk of perforation in between.
Has no absolute risk of ectopic pregnancy, but has relative risk.
## IUS (Mirena)
Mirena (LNG IUS)
- It contains levonorgestrel (progesterone)
- It prevents endometrial proliferation & thickens cervical mucus.
- IUS alleviates symptoms of Endometriosis, Adenomyosis, Fibroids.
- IUS is a major risk factor for PID (Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea).
- Has lowest failure rate (even less than lap tubal sterilization). 
## IUD (Copper-T)
Cu-T decreases sperm motility and survival.


# The pill ladder (Strengths of different contraceptive brands)
From GP Notebook.

In Table below, the first column is the micrograms of oestrogen. The three left hand columns are more progesterone dominant and the four right hand columns more oestrogen dominant pills:
- For LESS oestrogenic activity then move across ladders to the LEFT
- For LESS progestogenic activity then move across ladders to the RIGHT

\*\*30 - 40 indicates a variable dose of oestrogen.
\*\* 35 indicates a constant dose of oestrogen, but variable dose of progestogen

Examples: 
- if a woman is experiencing acne and mood swings on a progesterone dominant pill such as Microgynon, it is worth moving right across the ladders to a more oestrogen dominant pill such as Cilest. 
- if a woman is experiencing nausea and breast tenderness on an oestrogen dominant pill such as Femodene, it is worth moving left across the ladders to a more progesterone dominant pill such as Ovranette. A possible alternative move is to a pill containing less oestrogen but the same progestogen, e.g. Femodene to Femodette
- in general with **breakthrough bleeding**, it is worth trying a higher dose of oestrogen (of course pathology such as a cervical problem or a sexually transmitted infection (STI) needs to be excluded first). Certain progesterones are associated with better cycle control than others (LNG better than NET, GSD better than DSG) but if a woman finds a particular progesterone suits her, for example DSG, but she experiences beakthrough bleeding with a low dose 20 mcg EE (Mercilon), then you can try moving up the same ladder staying with the same progesterone but increasing to a 30 mcg EE pill (Marvelon)

Completely separating unwanted effects of oestrogen and progestogens is very difficult

- progestogens have varying degrees of progestogenicity (wanted effect, for contraception), androgenicity (unwanted effect , leading to spotty skin, greasy hair and hirsutism) and oestrogenicity. This can actually add or subtract from the 'apparent' level of oestrogenicity in the combined formulation. So, for example Cilest, although a 35 mcg pill, has, biologically the same long term effects as the 30 mcg pills, because it has very little oestrogenic activity
