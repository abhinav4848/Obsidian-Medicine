Ophthalmia neonatorum simply means infection of the newborn eye.  

In neonates, the aetiology of [[conjunctivitis]] can be diverse ranging from benign causes such as nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) to more serious ones such as bacterial infections. 

Responsible organisms include  
- _[[chlamydia]] trachomatis_ 
- _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_
  
Suspected ophthalmia neonatorum should be referred for same-day ophthalmology/paediatric assessment. 

# NLDO vs bacterial conjunctivitis
#confusion 
NLDO typically presents with watery or mucoid discharge without conjunctival injection, whereas bacterial conjunctivitis presents with purulent discharge along with conjunctival injection. Moreover, NLDO often responds well to conservative management such as lacrimal sac massage while bacterial conjunctivitis does not.
