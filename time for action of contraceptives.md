*If not day 1-5 of period*
#mnemonic 
I for Instant: IUD
2 days for POP
7 days for everything else: COC, injection, implant, IUS
# COCP 
If COC started within 5 days of the cycle, then no need for additional contraception. If any other day, then 7 days of alternative contraception.
# Progesterone Implant 
Nexplanon is an etonogestrel (progesterone) implant that prevents ovulation and thickens cervical mucus. If Nexplanon is inserted between day 1-5 of menstrual cycle, it will be effective immediately. However, if it is inserted at any other time in the cycle, it will not be effective until after 7 days. 
If patient was switching from POP or COCP, she'd be covered immediately. 
# Progesterone Pill
For POP, if started in day 1-5, immediate effects else after 2 days of additional protection. Also, POP has no pill-free break unlike COCP (21+7).
- If Pill missed > 3 hrs ago, take the missed pill and use additional protection for next 2 days.
- However, for Cerazette (desogestrel) a missed period of 12 hours is allowed
