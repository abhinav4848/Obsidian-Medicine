Chronic widespread pain + multiple muscular tender points / associated fatigue / sleep disturbance / cognitive dysfunction in the absence of a well-defined underlying organic disease. Majority of patients present with both myofascial tender points and associated somatic symptoms

Somatic symptoms: 
- Somatic symptoms are physical symptoms that originate from how the nervous system processes signals, rather than from clear structural disease or tissue damage. 
	- Real physical symptoms without an adequate structural or biochemical explanation, caused by altered central processing of sensation, pain, or autonomic function.
	- Key point: the symptoms are real — not imagined, not “put on”.
- Pain related somatic symptoms: [[irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]], migraine headaches, severe menstrual pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, myofascial facial pain, and temporomandibular pain are seen in FM

Explain to patients: “Your nerves have become over-sensitive, so normal signals are being experienced as pain or discomfort. The symptoms are real, but the problem is with how signals are processed, not with damage.”
