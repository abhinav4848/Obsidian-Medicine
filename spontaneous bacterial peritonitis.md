In case of people with cirrhosis/ongoing ascites, long-term prophylaxis with Abx against gram negative bacteria if high risk for SBP, such as
1. Previous episode of SBP or
2. Low ascitic fluid protein concentration (<= 15 g/L) .

MC organism in ascitisc fluid: E. coli.

# Management
**Prophylaxis**: 
Oral ciprofloxacin (or norfloxacin)

**Treat**: 
iv cefotaxime (most trusts use co-trimox) but answer as per NICE.

# LTOT
LTOT: long term O2 therapy for 15 hrs. a day
## When to assess need for LTOT
- FEV1 <30% of predicted. i.e. Very severe airflow obstruction
- SpO2 < 92% on room air
- Cyanosis
- Polycythemia
- Peripheral edema
- Raised JVP
## Conditions for assessment
- Patient should be stable > 5 weeks since last COPD exacerbation
- His therapy for COPD is fully optimized
- 2 sets ABG 3 weeks apart show him hypoxic

## Offer LTOT
pO2 < 7.3 kPa
pO2 of 7.3 - 8 kPa & any of:
- Secondary polycythemia
- Peripheral edema
- Pulmonary HTN

If already on LTOT but still breathless -> Prednisolone/nebulized NS to loosen secretions. Can also give carbocisteine for secretions although excess drug can cause excessive loose secretions. LVR (lung volume recruitment) bags help get enough air in to generate a cough.
