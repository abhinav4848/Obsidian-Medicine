# Primary Hyperaldosteronism
**Hypokalemia** (might be normoK)-> Cuz aldosterone causes Na absorption & H+/K+ excretion.
**Hypertension** (might be normal Na+ or upper normal).

- **Hypokalemia**: Muscle weakness.
- Refractory HTN despite >=3 drugs
- HTN before 40yo.
- Other manifestations like: Weakness, Lethargy, Headache.
- *Polyuria* due to aldosterone escape,
- Metabolic alkalosis. ([[addison's disease|Addison's]] has acidosis). 
## Investigation
**Check Plasma aldosterone to renin ratio.**
	(if A > R, 1* hyperaldosteronism), else if other way around, 2* hyperaldosteronism due to Renal artery stenosis (but U&e would be abnormal).
Then do HRCT & adrenal vein sampling to see if u/l or b/l.

## Treatment
for: 
- b/l adrenal hyperplasia, give 4 weeks of aldosterone receptor antagonist ([[spironolactone]]) before considering surgery.
- u/l adenoma: surgery (laparoscopic adrenalectomy).

## Extra
**Primary Hyperaldosteronism**: no edema due to aldosterone escape.
	The fault is in the organ producing aldosterone itself.
	E.g. Adenoma, b/l hyperplasia

**Secondary Hyperaldosteronism**: some causes may cause edema (HF, Renal Failure)
	Fault lies outside adrenals. i.e. Something that will reduce blood flow to Kidney-> Renin increases -> Aldosterone increases.
	E.g. Blockage, compression, stenosis, CLD, HF, Diuretic medications.
