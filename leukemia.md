Chronic has mature cells.
Acute has immature cells.
# ALL
Children (<15yo), [[Down's syndrome]].

Pancytopenia (either ALL or Aplastic anaemia).
- Anaemia: Lethargy and pallor.
- WBCs can be any value - fever can be present in up-to 50% of new cases (due to infection or constitutional symptoms)
- Thrombocytopenia will have petechiae (they're non-blanching) - May present with hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications due to DIC.Â 

Tends to infiltrate other organs (ALL>AML): Hepato-splenomegaly, LN, Bone pain, testicular swelling. 

If only Gum hypertrophy, and in less acute setting -> ALL.

Bone marrow biopsy: Numerous blasts.

[[Aplastic anaemia]] won't have splenomegaly #confusion 
# AML
Adults (20 - 30 yo)  
Gingivitis, Gum swelling, Gum bleed (but can also happen in ALL).

[[cell histology|Auer rods]] on blood film.
Bone marrow biopsy: Numerous blasts

[[Myelodysplastic, Myeloproliferative syndrome#Myelodysplastic syndrome|Myelodysplastic syndrome]] can progress to AML. 
# CLL
Older (> 65 yo)  
Asymptomatic/Anemia/Recurrent infection/LNE.  
B-lymphocyte predominant. Cervical LNE.

Increased WBC, but non functioning  
Smear: [[cell histology|Smudge cells]], Mature lymphocytes.
# CML
Middle age (40 - 50 yo)
Massive splenomegaly (seen in either CML or malaria- h/o travelling)  
Granulocytes at all stages of development (myelocytes, metamyelocytes). No Blasts.  
Neutrophils predominant.

Philadelphia present in both CML and ALL, but in CML, it is the diagnostic factor where as in ALL, it is a prognostic factor. So if Philadelphia chromosome is present in ALL, then bad prognosis.
