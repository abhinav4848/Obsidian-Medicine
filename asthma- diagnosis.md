## First line investigation
Measure eosinophil count OR Fractional Nitric Oxide (FeNO)
Can diagnose asthma without further investigations if:
- Eosinophil above reference range
- FeNO >= 50ppb.
## Second line investigation
If asthma not confirmed by above tests,
- Measure bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) with spirometry. Diagnose asthma if:
	- FEV1 increases >=12%, and >=200ml from pre BD measurement, or
	- FEV1 increases >=10% of predicted normal FEV1
- Otherwise do PEF (peak expiratory flow) twice daily for 2 weeks. Diagnose asthma if:
	- PEF Variability > 20%Â  seen after monitoring at least BD for 2-4 weeks
## Third line
If asthma still not confirmed with Eosinophil count, FeNO, BDR, PEF variability but still suspected on clinical grounds:
- Refer for consideration of Bronchial Challenge test
- Diagnose asthma if bronchial hyper-responsiveness is present.
