# Diagnose Asthma in Adults

![[diagnose asthma in people over 16yo.jpg]]
## First line investigation
Measure eosinophil count OR Fractional Nitric Oxide ([[asthma- investigations|FeNO]])
Can diagnose asthma without further investigations if:
- Eosinophil above reference range
- FeNO >= 50ppb.
## Second line investigation
If asthma not confirmed by above tests,
- Measure bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) with [[spirometry]]. Diagnose asthma if:
	- FEV1 increases >=12%, and >=200ml from pre BD measurement, or
	- FEV1 increases >=10% of predicted normal FEV1
- Otherwise do PEF (peak expiratory flow) twice daily for 2 weeks. Diagnose asthma if:
	- PEF Variability (expressed as 'amplitude percentage mean') > 20%Â  seen after monitoring at least BD for 2-4 weeks. 
## Third line
If asthma still not confirmed with Eosinophil count, FeNO, BDR, PEF variability but still suspected on clinical grounds:
- Refer for consideration of Bronchial Challenge test. - Diagnose asthma if bronchial hyper-responsiveness is present.

# Diagnose asthma in children aged 5-16yo
![[diagnose asthma in ages 5-16yo.jpg]]

FeNO >= 35ppb

If level not raised or test can't be done
- BDR with spirometry
If no spirometry
- PEF twice daily for 2 weeks

If still not confirmed by FeNO, BDR, PEF, but still suspected
- skin price test to house dust mite, OR
- measure total IgE + eosinophil count.
Exclude asthma if no sensitisation to house dust mite, OR if total serum IgE not raised. 
Diagnose asthma if evidence of sensitisation OR a raised IgE & eosinophil count >0.5x10^9/L

If still doubt, Bronchial challenge test
