## 1. Antacids – _chemical neutralisers_
**What they do**
- Directly **neutralise gastric acid** already present in the stomach.
- Raise intragastric pH temporarily. 

**Examples**
- Calcium carbonate
- Magnesium hydroxide
- Aluminium hydroxide
- (Often combined, e.g. Maalox-type preparations)

**Key features**
- **Rapid onset** (minutes)
- **Short duration** (1–2 hours)
- Symptomatic relief only

**Clinical use**
- Occasional, mild dyspepsia
- “Rescue” therapy

## 2. Alginates – _mechanical barrier_
**What they do**
- React with gastric acid to form a **viscous gel/raft** that floats on top of stomach contents.
- Acts as a **physical barrier** preventing reflux into the oesophagus.
- Many preparations also contain **antacids**, but the alginate effect is the key distinction.

**Examples**
- Gaviscon Advance

**Key features**
- Onset: **quick**
- Works best **post-prandially**
- Particularly effective for **reflux** rather than epigastric pain

**Clinical use**
- GORD, especially:
    - Post-meal reflux
    - Pregnancy
    - Breakthrough symptoms on PPIs
- Useful when you want **symptom relief without systemic acid suppression**

## 3. PPIs – _acid production blockers_
**What they do**
- Irreversibly inhibit the **H⁺/K⁺ ATPase (proton pump)** in parietal cells.
- Dramatically reduce **acid secretion**.

**Examples**
- Omeprazole
- Lansoprazole
- Esomeprazole
- Pantoprazole

**Key features**
- **Slow onset** (24–72 hours for full effect)
- **Long duration**
- Most potent acid suppression
- No immediate relief

**Clinical use**
- GORD with erosive disease
- Peptic ulcer disease
- H. pylori eradication
- Barrett’s oesophagus
- NSAID protection

**Side effects of PPI**
- Long term use can cause increased risk of fractures.

## Common UK prescribing logic
- **Mild, intermittent symptoms** → antacid or alginate PRN
- **Post-prandial reflux** → alginate first-line
- **Frequent or complicated GORD** → PPI
- **Breakthrough reflux on PPI** → add alginate (not increase PPI automatically)
