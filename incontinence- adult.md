# Voiding (Obstructive/Overflow)
### Clinical Features
#mnemonic SHIP
- Straining due to sense of incomplete voiding, 
- Hesitancy, 
- Intermittent/Incontinence, 
- Poor flow/weak stream, 
- terminal/post-void dribbling
### Aetiology
Due to bladder outlet obstruction. 
- [[Anticholinergics]] 
	- [[antipsychotic drugs|Antipsychotics]],
	- Older antihistamines with anti-ch activity
	- [[tricyclic antidepressants|TCAs]] have anticholinergic effects which may lead to urinary retention, leading to frequent leaking. 
- [[nsaid|NSAIDs]]
- Disopyramide
- [[prostate|BPH]]- causes both storage, and voiding symptoms. 
- Codeine can cause urinary retention. 
### Rx: 
Alpha blockers:
- If normotensive: Tamsulosin
- HTN: Doxazosin, Alfuzosin
5-alpha reductase inhibitor: Finasteride (reduces Prostate bulk -> takes up to 6 months to show results).
Doxazosin is step 4 in [[hypertension|HTN]] management.

# Storage (Irritative/Urge/Overactive)
#mnemonic FUN
Detrusor instability: Frequency, urgency, Nocturia.
### Treatment
Bladder drill (retraining)
Antimuscarinics
- oxybutynin- use with caution in elderly women,
	- direct spasmolytic effect on the bladder smooth muscle by competitively antagonising the muscarinic receptors on the bladder.
- tolterodine
- darifenacin
Mirabegron ([[beta adrenergic receptors|beta 3 agonist]])

\* Bladder training: You feel like going to the loo, hold it for 5 mins then go. Next time, hold it for 10 mins then go.
