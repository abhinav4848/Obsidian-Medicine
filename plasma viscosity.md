Says how thick plasma is. 
==Practically, if testing PV, always request FBC. ==

It reflects concentration of plasma proteins, mainly: 
- Fibrinogen,
- Immunoglobulins

It is affected by the presence of proteins produced in normal response to infection or inflammation, or abnormally in certain diseases (paraproteins)

Inflammation → ↑ acute phase proteins → ↑ plasma thickness → **↑ plasma viscosity** 
## Why do we use it?
Think of PV as an alternative to ESR, with some advantages.
PV is not specific for rheumatological conditions and there are many other conditions that can lead to a raised PV level. 

### What it tells you
- Presence of **systemic inflammation**
- Chronic inflammatory activity
- Paraproteinaemia (e.g. [[multiple myeloma|myeloma]], Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, Hyper-gamma-globulinemia)

|Feature|Plasma viscosity|ESR|CRP|
|---|---|---|---|
|Measures|Plasma protein concentration|RBC sedimentation|Acute phase protein|
|Affected by age|❌ No|✅ Yes|❌ No|
|Affected by anaemia|❌ No|✅ Yes|❌ No|
|Responds quickly|❌ Moderate|❌ Slow|✅ Fast|
|Stable over time|✅ Yes|❌ No|❌ No|
|Good in paraproteins|✅ Yes|❌ Unreliable|❌|

## Why PV can be normal when ESR/CRP are not (and vice versa)
- **CRP** rises fast and falls fast
- **ESR** depends on RBC properties
- **PV** reflects **overall protein load**, so:
    - Less day-to-day variation
    - Better for chronic inflammation

👉 That’s why rheumatologists like it.

>[!warning] Be aware:
> - Patients with [[sjogren's syndrome]] will have high PV due to raised IgG, so PV will be chronically elevated. 
> - Obesity causes raised PV, possibly due to insulin resistance and high fibrinogen levels.
