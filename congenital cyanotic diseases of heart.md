# ToF
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cause of cyanotic congenital heart disease typically presenting at around 1-2 months, although picked up up to 6 months.
![[tetralogy of fallot.png]]
## Clinical Features
- The severity of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction determines the degree of cyanosis and clinical severity
- cyanosis
	- Unrepaired TOF infants may develop episodic hypercyanotic 'tet' spells due to near occlusion of the right ventricular outflow tract
	- Features of tet spells include tachypnoea and severe cyanosis that may occasionally result in loss of consciousness.
	- they typically occur when an infant is upset, is in pain, at feeding times, or has a fever
- causes a right-to-left shunt
- ejection systolic murmur due to pulmonary stenosis (the VSD doesn't usually cause a murmur)
- a right-sided aortic arch is seen in 25% of patients
- chest x-ray shows a 'boot-shaped' heart, ECG shows right ventricular hypertrophy

## Management
- surgical repair is often undertaken in two parts
- cyanotic episodes may be helped by beta-blockers to reduce infundibular spasm

# TGA
presents within the first 24 hours of life.

# Duct dependent cardiac lesions
Tetralogy of Fallot, ebstein’s anomaly, pulmonary atresia and pulmonary stenosis.

The PDA is allowing oxygenated blood to still get to the aorta, and deoxygenated to the lungs, less efficiently than if it was just a normal healthy heart without PDA, but the PDA is compensating for the cyanotic effect of the cardiac anomaly

They are often diagnosed antenatally but may present at birth with
1. cyanosis,
2. tachypnoea and
3. poor peripheral pulses.

Often the definitive treatment is surgery, however keeping the duct open with Prostaglandin E1 can buy time for the management to be appropriately planned.
