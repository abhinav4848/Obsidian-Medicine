Develops before 8 weeks. 

# Treat
- Position during feeds: 30 degrees head up.
- infant to sleep on their back to prevent cot death
- do not overfeed and give small frequent feeds:
	- A formula fed infant with GORD should have feeds reduced to 150ml/kg per day (6-8 hrs.).
- try thickened formula
- try alginate therapy
- Try PPI only if:
	- unexplained feeding difficulties (for example, refusing feeds, gagging or choking)
	- distressed behavior
	- faltering growth

Offering a trial of feed thickeners or alginate therapy added to formula are both options in NICE's stepped care approach that can be trialed if reducing the volume of feeds and ensuring feeds are small and frequent have not improved symptoms significantly.
