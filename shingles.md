---
acute, unilateral, painful, blistering rash caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, after primary infection with VZV ([[chicken pox]]). 
Virus lies dormant in dorsal root/cranial nerve (facial) ganglia. 

# Risk factor
- increasing age
- [[HIV]] (strong risk factor)- 15x more common
- immunosuppressive conditions (steroids, chemo)

# Clinical Features
- commonly affects dermatomes T1-L2. 
- prodromal period
    - burning pain over the affected dermatome for 2-3 days
    - pain may be severe and interfere with sleep
    - around 20% of patients will experience fever, headache, lethargy
- rash
    - initially erythematous, macular #rash over the affected dermatome
    - quickly becomes vesicular
    - characteristically is well demarcated by the dermatome and does not cross the midline. However, some 'bleeding' into adjacent areas may be seen
# Diagnosis 
- clinical
# Management
- Patients are potentially infectious
	- Avoid pregnant women & immunosuppressed people. 
	- infectious, until vesicles have [[school in children with rash|crusted over]]- i.e. 5-7 days following onset. 
	- covering lesions reduces the risk. 
- Analgesia
	- PCT, NSAID are first line 
	- else, neuropathic agents (e.g. amitriptyline)
	- else oral [[corticosteroid]] in first 2 weeks in immunocompetent adults with localized shingles if pain severe and not responding to above treatments. 
- Antivirals
	- Start antivirals within 72 hrs of onset, unless patient age <50, and mild truncal rash + mild pain + no risk factors. 
	- antivirals reduce the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia, esp in elderly
	- Use: acyclovir, famciclovir, or valaciclovir

# Complications
- Post-Herpetic neuralgia
	- resolves in 6 months but may last longer. 
- herpes zoster ophthalmicus (shingles affecting ocular division of trigeminal nerve)
- herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome)- may result in ear lesions and facial paralysis.
