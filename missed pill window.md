# COCP
[NHS Link](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/miss-combined-pill/)
Adherence window of 24 hours. 

1 pill missed
- take the last pill asap even it means taking 2 pills in one day. No further action needed.
- She can take the 7-day pill-free break as normal it is only 1 missed pill.

\>=2 pills missed
- Take the last pill, even if it means taking 2 pills in one day. Leave any earlier missed pills and then continue taking pills daily as usual.
- Use condom/abstain until she's taken pills 7 days in a row.
- if pills are missed in
	- week 1 (Days 1-7): [[contraceptives in emergency|Emergency contraception]] should be considered if she had UPSI in the pill-free interval (week 4) or in week 1
		- USPI during the pill free interval is only safe if week 1 is started on time
	- week 2 (Days 8-14): after seven consecutive days of taking the COC there is no need for emergency contraception*, but use extra contraception.
		- \*theoretically women would be protected if they took the COC in a pattern of 7 days on, 7 days off
	- week 3 (Days 15-21): she should finish the pills in her current pack and start a new pack the next day; thus omitting the pill free interval
		- Rephrase: If missed >=2 , and there were fewer than 7 pills left in the pack, she would have to start the next pack without a break.
