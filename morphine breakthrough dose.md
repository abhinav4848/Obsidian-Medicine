revision notes: increasing regular morphine dose via PRNs
revision counter:
  - "1"
---
Main dose
	Total dose in 24 hrs./2 so you can give it BD as main dose.
Additional dose/breakthrough dose
	Breakthrough dose is 1/6th the daily morphine dose.
	Total of new dose in 24 hrs/6, is the dose in 4 hrs.
	or 10% of total daily dose given 4 hourly.

If a patient has had to use PRN oramorph, say 40mg in a day, then add that to the total daily morphine intake when converting to syringe driver. 

When increasing the dose of opioids the next dose should be increased by 30-50%. #important

>If patient is on 50mg BD & took 70mg PRN, then adding on the PRN would make the BD dose 85mg which is more than 30-50% increase from the previous dose of 50mg. So max strength of new BD dose will be $1.3 * 50= 65 mg$ to $1.5*50=75 mg$. 
>Increase the regular dose of morphine every 2-3 days.

Oxycodone is preferred to morphine in palliative patients with mild-moderate renal impairment. Oxycodone generally causes less sedation, vomiting and pruritis than morphine but more constipation.

Morphine is cheaper, but also if we started everyone on oxycodone instead of morphine, then they'd still have same number of side effects. But the only difference is that the ones who don't tolerate morphine, we can try oxycodone on them in the hope that this has less side effects.

## Transdermal Patch
- a transdermal fentanyl 12 microgram patch equates to approximately 30 mg oral morphine daily
- a transdermal buprenorphine 10 microgram (Sevodyne) patch equates to approximately 24 mg oral morphine daily.
