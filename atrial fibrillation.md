# Causes
#mnemonic : PIRATES Mnemonic for new-onset atrial fibrillation
- Pulmonary causes (OSA, PE, [[COPD]], pneumonia)  
- Ischemia/Infarction/CAD  
- Rheumatic heart disease and Mitral Regurgitation (abnormal heart valve)  
- Alcohol / Anaemia (high output failure)  
- [[hyperthyroidism|Thyrotoxicosis]] / Toxins, especially stimulant medications, caffeine, tobacco or alcohol  
- Electrolytes/Endocarditis  
- Sepsis (infection) / Sick sinus syndrome.

Other causes:
- High blood pressure
- Congenital heart defects
- Previous heart surgery
- Viral infections
- Stress due to surgery or other illnesses

PIRATES drink a lot of alcohol and their blood pressure is high.

# Management
Do CHA2DS2-VASc + ORBIT Score -> give DOAC (if c/I e.g. valvular AF, then warfarin)
### Acute presentation ([NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng196/chapter/Recommendations#management-for-people-presenting-acutely-with-atrial-fibrillation))
In people with new‑onset atrial fibrillation who are receiving no, or subtherapeutic, anticoagulation therapy:
- in the absence of contraindications (e.g. AF started within 48 hrs), offer heparin at initial presentation
- continue heparin until a full assessment has been made and appropriate antithrombotic therapy has been started, based on risk stratification (bleeding risk)
### Rate Control
BB or rate limiting CCB (e.g. Diltiazem).
If one drug doesn't control adequately, combine the following:
- BB
- Diltiazem
- Digoxin
	- Digoxin should be used with caution usually in patients with A. Fib & intolerance to beta blocker. It can be used for short term control of A Fib. It should only be used in sedentary patients with AF cuz it has no effect on heart rate in exertion.
### Rhythm Control
- Drugs such as flecainide may be used for chemical cardioversion. Do not use flecainide in the presence of HF, LV impairment, IHD, or prolonged QT interval. Cardiovert only in new AF <48 hrs or anticoagulation for > 3 weeks cuz risk of thromboembolism.
- Amiodarone (300 mg over 20-60 min followed by 900 mg over 24 h) may be used to attempt chemical cardioversion but is less often effective than drugs like flecainide and takes longer to work.
- Electrical cardioversion remains an option in this setting and will restore sinus rhythm in more patients than chemical cardioversion.
### Cardioversion
- If Onset <48 hrs ago: Following electrical cardioversion if AF is confirmed as being less than 48 hours duration then further anticoagulation is unnecessary.
- If Onset > 48 hrs: Following electrical cardioversion patients should be anticoagulated for at least 4 weeks.
### Stroke risk
- Do not offer stroke prevention therapy with anticoagulation to <65 years with atrial fibrillation and no risk factors other than their sex (that is, very low risk of stroke equating to a CHA2DS2‑VASc score of 0 for men or 1 for women).
- Aspirin is not useful to prevent primary stroke. It's used for treatment of stroke.
### [[scoring system|Orbit Score]]
- Older >=75yo
- Reduced Hb (<13 men, <12 women)
- Bleeding history
- Insufficient eGFR <60
- Treatment with antiplatelet
