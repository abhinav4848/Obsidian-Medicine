# Clinical
Six broad nausea and vomiting syndromes  

**Reduced gastric motility**
- May be opioid related
- Related to [[5-ht receptors (serotonin receptors)|Serotonin]] (5HT4) and dopamine (D2) receptors
- Can use [[Metoclopramide]]/Domperidone **unless** prokinetic effect will have negative effects, e.g. Complete bowel obstruction, GI perforation, soon after gastric surgery, Colic
- Use case: Gastric Stasis (patient with malignant ascites feeling nausea/bloated/passing wind/BNO 2 days/No Colic). 

**Chemically mediated**
- Secondary to hypercalcaemia, opioids, or chemotherapy
- Can use [[Ondansetron]], [[Haloperidol]], Levomepromazine

**Visceral/Serosal**
- Due to constipation
- Oral candidiasis
- Cyclizine and levomepromazine are first-line
- Anti-cholinergics such as hyoscine can be useful

**Raised intra-cranial pressure**
- Due to high ICP (e.g. brain metastasis, intracerebral tumour e.g. glioblastoma) or vomiting due to bowel obstruction -> Cyclizine.
- Give Dexamethasone to shrink perilesional (intracerebral) edema -> elevates ICP symptoms. 4mg QID PO or IV.
- If GCS <=8, intubate & give Mannitol for raised ICP.
- If GCS very low + neurological deficit (unequal pupils) & ICH, do craniotomy

**Vestibular (BPPV, Meniere, Vestibular neuritis)***
- Related to activation of acetylcholine and histamine (H1) receptors-> cyclizine works best. Can also use [[Metoclopramide]]/Prochlorperazine for refractory cases. Or can even use Olanzapine/Risperidone as per UpToDate. 
- Most frequently in palliative care is opioid related
- Can be motion related, or due to base of skull tumours

**Cortical**
- May be due to anxiety, pain, fear and/or anticipatory nausea
- Related to GABA and histamine (H1) receptors in the cerebral cortex
- Can use Lorazepam, else cyclizine. Can trial ondansetron/metoclopramide

**Hyperemesis gravidarum**
The first step is IV fluids
*See [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy]].* 
- 1st line: "zine" family e.g. Cyclizine, Promethazine
- 2nd line: IV Metoclopramide, Ondansetron
- 3rd line: Steroids
# Treatments
[[D2 antagonism]]- [[metoclopramide]], domperidone, [[antipsychotic drugs|Prochlorperazine]], [[haloperidol]]. 

Serotonin receptor antagonists (5HT3 antagonists): [[Ondansetron]], Granisetron
- Strong central antiemetic effect at the [[areas of brain|CTZ]]. 
- peripheral antiemetic effect via inhibition of vagus nerve.

[[anticholinergics|AntiCholinergics]]- Scopolamine.
- Works on CTZ & vestibular system.  
- Inhibits vagus nerve. 
- used in motion sickness 

Antihistamines- Promethazine, Dimenhydrinate, Diphenhydramine
- H1 antagonist
- Works on CTZ & vestibular system. 
- Sedative. Can cause drowsiness & confusion
- Hyperemesis gravidarum

Neurokinin receptor antagonists- Aprepitant, Fosaprepitant
- NK1 antagonist in [[areas of brain|solitary nucleus]] & CTZ. 
- Also inhibit substance P-induced vomiting. Substance P is a neurotransmitter of afferent neurons involved in the pharyngeal or “gag” reflex.
- used in Chemo induced N&V (CINV). 

Glucocorticoids- Dex, Methylpred
- central antiemetic effect by interacting with glucocorticoid receptors in solitary nucleus. 
- Good for post op NV & CINV

Benzodiazepines- Loraz
- central effect due to depression of CTZ

Atypical [[antipsychotic drugs|antipsychotics]]- Olanzapine
- Central action by inhibiting dopamine, serotonin, histamine

See [[anticipatory meds|drugs in palliative care]] for Haloperidol, Levomepromazine. 

# Notes
- We can combine different classes of antiemetics for patients who are undergoing chemo & have not responded to initial treatments. 
- If treatment is not effective, aim to change rather than add medication. In particular, avoid prokinetics in combination with cyclizine as they have an antagonistic effect with each other. Sometimes, however, a combination is appropriate. 
- **Remember oropharyngeal irritation**. Perhaps due to candidiasis, this is an under-recognised and reversible cause of retching and vomiting – just take a look to check for this!
