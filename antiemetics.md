# Clinical
Six broad nausea and vomiting syndromes  

**Reduced gastric motility**
- May be opioid related
- Related to serotonin (5HT4) and dopamine (D2) receptors
- Can use Metoclopramide/Domperidone unless prokinetic effect will have negative effects, e.g. Complete bowel obstruction, GI perforation, soon after gastric surgery. 

**Chemically mediated**
- Secondary to hypercalcaemia, opioids, or chemotherapy
- Can use Ondansetron, Haloperidol, Levomepromazine

**Visceral/Serosal**
- Due to constipation
- Oral candidiasis
- Cyclizine and levomepromazine are first-line
- Anti-cholinergics such as hyoscine can be useful

**Raised intra-cranial pressure**
- Due to high ICP (e.g. brain metastasis, intracerebral tumour e.g. glioblastoma) or vomiting due to bowel obstruction -> Cyclizine.
- Give Dexamethasone to shrink perilesional (intracerebral) edema -> elevates ICP symptoms. 4mg QID PO or IV.
- If GCS <=8, intubate & give Mannitol for raised ICP.
- If GCS very low + neurological deficit (unequal pupils) & ICH, do craniotomy

**Vestibular (BPPV, Meniere, Vestibular neuritis)***
- Related to activation of acetylcholine and histamine (H1) receptors-> cyclizine works best. Can also use Metoclopramide/Prochlorperazine for refractory cases. Or can even use Olanzapine/Risperidone as per UpToDate. 
- Most frequently in palliative care is opioid related
- Can be motion related, or due to base of skull tumours

**Cortical**
- May be due to anxiety, pain, fear and/or anticipatory nausea
- Related to GABA and histamine (H1) receptors in the cerebral cortex
- Can use Loraz, else cyclizine. Can trial ondansetron/metoclopramide

**Hyperemesis gravidarum**
The first step is IV fluids
- 1st line: "zine" family e.g. Cyclizine, Promethazine
- 2nd line: IV Metoclopramide, Ondansetron
- 3rd line: Steroids
# Treatments
[[D2 antagonism]]- [[metoclopramide]], domperidone, [[antipsychotic drugs|Prochlorperazine]], [[haloperidol]]. 

Serotonin receptor antagonists (5HT3 antagonists): Ondansetron, Granisetron
- Strong central antiemetic effect at the [[areas of brain|CTZ]]. 
- peripheral antiemetic effect via inhibition of vagus nerve.

[[anticholinergics|AntiCholinergics]]- Scopolamine.
- Works on CTZ & vestibular system.  
- Inhibits vagus nerve. 
- used in motion sickness 

Antihistamines- Promethazine, Dimenhydrinate, Diphenhydramine
- H1 antagonist
- Works on CTZ & vestibular system. 
- Sedative. Can cause drowsiness & confusion
- Hyperemesis gravidarum

Neurokinin receptor antagonists- Aprepitant, Fosaprepitant
- NK1 antagonist in [[areas of brain|solitary nucleus]] & CTZ. 
- Also inhibit substance P-induced vomiting. Substance P is a neurotransmitter of afferent neurons involved in the pharyngeal or “gag” reflex.
- used in Chemo induced N&V (CINV). 

Glucocorticoids- Dex, Methylpred
- central antiemetic effect by interacting with glucocorticoid receptors in solitary nucleus. 
- Good for post op NV & CINV

Benzodiazepines- Loraz
- central effect due to depression of CTZ

Atypical [[antipsychotic drugs|antipsychotics]]- Olanzapine
- Central action by inhibiting dopamine, serotonin, histamine
