Placebo is an inert substance that mimics the appearance and administration of an active drug but lacks pharmacological activity.  
  
Active placebo: Has noticeable side effects but no therapeutic effect for the condition being treated. e.g. Atropine has been used to mimic the anticholinergic side effects of antidepressants. 
  
**Nocebo**: Expectation of negative effects causes patient's to experience that effect. 

# Types of Placebo
Placebos can be non-pharmacological, such as sham procedures (e.g. sham electroconvulsive therapy), where the setup is performed but no active treatment is delivered.  
  
Placebo effects are influenced by context: 
- Treatments perceived as more potent (e.g. injections, capsules) generally produce a stronger placebo effect than those seen as weaker 
- **Colour, size, route**, and **branding** all influence placebo strength
- The professional status and confidence of the clinician can enhance the effect

# Placebo in psychiatric conditions
Placebo responses are notable in psychiatric disorders like depression:  
- Responses to placebo tend to occur early and abruptly, and may not persist. 
- [[depression|antidepressant]] responses are typically gradual and more sustained
- A pattern of abrupt improvement may indicate a transient placebo effect even if the patient is on an active treatment

# Placebo sag
Placebo sag refers to diminishing placebo effects with repeated use, although this term is not widely adopted in clinical literature.  
  

The following are selected facts about placebos: 
- Placebo is not equivalent to no care; regular clinical contact improves outcomes
- **Placebo response is more marked in mild illness** 
- High placebo rates can reduce the power of clinical trials
- **Spontaneous remission** and regression to the mean make it hard to distinguish placebo effects
- Active placebos may reduce unblinding and expectancy bias
- Placebo response rates in trials are increasing over time
- Placebo effects are typically short-lived, though not universally so
