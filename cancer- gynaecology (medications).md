# Drugs used in gynae cancers
## Tamoxifen
- **Anti-Estrogenic action on**: Breast (reduces ER+ve tumor size), Peripheral sites (hot flushes)
- **Estrogenic action on**: Endometrium (proliferation), Bone (Anti-resorptive), Plasma lipid (reduces Chl), Blood (VTE)

## Raloxifene
- **Anti-Estrogenic action on**: Breast (reduces tumor size), Endometrium (No proliferation)
- **Estrogenic action on**: Bone (Anti-resorptive), Plasma lipid (reduces Chl), Blood (Increase VTE)

## Summary
Both reduce Breast cancer, protect bone, keep lipid low. 
Both increase risk of VTE. 
Tamoxifen causes Endometrial Ca, Raloxifene doesn't.
