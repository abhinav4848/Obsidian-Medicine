# Onychomycosis
should be confirmed with laboratory testing before either topical or oral treatment is prescribed. Although the most likely cause would be onychomycosis (fungal nail infection), it could just as well be due to another condition such as psoriasis so it would be beneficial to confirm fungal involvement.
  
Topical treatments are generally not ideal for nail infections.  
Use topical steroid if nail clipping doesn't show fungus, but rather indicates inflammatory dermatosis such as psoriasis.
