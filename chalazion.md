Meibomian cyst -> retention cyst of the eyelid -> Firm, painless.

It usually presents as a painless lump within the eyelid itself and not at its margin. 
# Treatment
Initially: conservative. Apply warm compresses to the affected eye.

4 weeks after conservative management (e.g. applying warm compresses) -> the chalazion still present -> refer to an ophthalmologist (esp. if large and symptomatic)
