Blood glucose < 4.
Can occur during sports when player collapses with features of hypoglycemia.
# Due to:
1. Alcohol (commonest cause in adults)
2. Liver failure (impaired gluconeogenesis),
3. Relative disbalance vs glucose & insulin
4. **Drugs**: Excess PCT/Aspirin, Sulphonylureas (Glibenclamide, Gliclazide), [[beta adrenergic receptors#Liver|beta blockers]]. 
5. Addison's disease: Low cortisol -> Low glucose.
6. Insulinoma

# Dx
Whipple triad #triad 
1. Low plasma **glucose < 4**
2. c/f of hypoglycemia: Tachycardia, sweating, Confusion, Altered mentation, hypotension
3. If blood glucose corrected -> rapid resolution of symptoms.

# Treatment
If conscious & can swallow-> 200ml fruit juice

If conscious but can't swallow-> 200ml 10% glucose iv, or 1mg glucagon im or sc.

If unconscious-> 
	No hydrocortisone to be given, no oral to be given.
	- Iv 75ml of 20% glucose (10-15 mins), or
	- Iv 50ml of 10% glucose (1-2 mins), or
	- im/sc 1mg glucagon.

Oral glucose gel is absorbed via buccal mucosa but is useful only in drowsy patients, not unconscious patients.

Patient keeps getting dizzy & hypoglycemic attacks:
- If patient on [[diabetes drugs|metformin]] & Sulphonylureas -> Stop Sulphonylureas.
- If patient on metformin & long acting insulin (This may be seen in patients not eating well) -> reduce/stop the dose of long acting insulin.
