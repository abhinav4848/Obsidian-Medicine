# Investigations
Urea rises when patient has a blood meal- [[upper gi bleed|Upper GI bleed]].
to check kidney function for [[chronic kidney disease]]. 

# Medication
Urea is also used in creams with [[corticosteroid#Topical steroid preparations|steroids]]: 
- **Humectant** → draws water into the stratum corneum
- **Keratolytic (at higher %)** → softens and breaks down thick scale (so thins the thickened skin, allowing steroid to penetrate & work better- thus making lower potency steroid effective)
- Improves skin barrier function. 

👉 Particularly useful in: 
- Chronic [[eczema]], [[lichens|Lichen Simplex Chronicus]], Ichthyosis, Hyperkeratotic [[psoriasis]]. 
- **Urea stings** on inflamed or broken skin → warn patients
- Avoid urea on **acute, weepy eczema**.
