# Tachypnoea
respiratory rate 
- >50 breaths/minute, age 6-12 months;
- >40 breaths/minute, age >12 months

*For [[scoring system|CURB-65]]: RR > 30*

Increased RR often precedes desaturation in respiratory illness
Count RR for a full minute, particularly in infants, as breathing can be irregular
# Tachycardia
- >160 beats/minute, age <12 months
- >150 beats/minute, age 12-24 months
- >140 beats/minute, age 2-5 years
Early sign of distress- tachycardia compensates for a fixed stroke volume

For <12yo HR <60
# Temperature
- Neonates and young infants may not mount a febrile response to infection. They may present with low temperature or poor feeding rather than pyrexia.
- Red flag sepsis:
	- Under 3 months: temp > 38C
	- Under 5 years: temp <36C
- Always investigate fever in infants <3 months thoroughly (e.g. sepsis, UTI, meningitis)
- Fever lasting more than 5 days should be assessed for [[kawasaki disease]]. 
# Passing urine
- Important for sepsis
All ages: Not passed urine in the past 12 (infants) to 18 hours, OR for catheterised patients passed 0.5 to 1 ml/kg of urine per hour

> For any child with fever, note oral mucosa and capillary refill time, weak pulse, cool extremities
# BP
##### How low is too low a BP?
- 1 month to 1 year: SBP <70
- 1y to 10 years: SBP < (70+ (2 x age))
- 11y to 17y: SBP <90
