# Tachypnoea
respiratory rate 
- >50 breaths/minute, age 6-12 months;
- >40 breaths/minute, age >12 months

For [[scoring system|CURB-65]]: RR > 30

Increased RR often precedes desaturation in respiratory illness
Count RR for a full minute, particularly in infants, as breathing can be irregular
# Tachycardia
- >160 beats/minute, age <12 months
- >150 beats/minute, age 12-24 months
- >140 beats/minute, age 2-5 years
Early sign of distress- tachycardia compensates for a fixed stroke volume
# Temp:
- Neonates and young infants may not mount a febrile response to infection. They may present with low temperature or poor feeding rather than pyrexia.
- Always investigate fever in infants <3 months thoroughly (e.g. sepsis, UTI, meningitis)
