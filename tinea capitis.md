*Trichophyton schoenleinii* is another dermatophyte fungus, which primarily causes tinea capitis (scalp ringworm). Tinea capitis typically causes patchy hair loss and a scaly scalp rather than generalised itching and flaking. 
- Scarring [[Alopecia]] on head.
- Highly contagious.
# Treatment
Scalp:
- Topical [[ketoconazole]] shampoo should be given for the first two weeks to reduce transmission.
for hair and nail involvement: Oral.
- Terbinafine for *Trichophyton tonsurans* infections
- Griseofulvin for *Microsporum* infections.

**Adults**: Oral Terbinafine > itraconazole, Fluconazole
**Child**: Griseofulvin.

For rest: topical.

# Extra
*Microsporum audouinii*, also a cause of tinea capitis, would similarly result in patchy hair loss rather than widespread itching and flaking. It's important to note that while both *T. schoenleinii* and *M. audouinii* can cause scalp infections, they are more commonly seen in children rather than adults.
