# Treatment
## Children: 
Treat with [[Methylphenidate]] as first line. 
	Only available in age 5 or more. 

If there is inadequate response, switch to lisdexamfetamine;
	Dexamphetamine should be started in those who have benefited from lisdexamfetamine, but who can't tolerate its side effects.
## Adults
- [[Methylphenidate]] or lisdexamfetamine are first-line options;
- Switch between these drugs if no benefit is seen after a trial of the other.
