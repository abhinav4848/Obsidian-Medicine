HbA1c target < 48 (i.e. Pre-diabetic levels are acceptable)
	*See [[diabetes mellitus- diagnosis]]*
# Treatment based on target levels
If new diagnosis: Lifestyle advice
	**Exercise**: 30 mins moderate intensity physical activity 5 times/week.
	
If Lifestyle modification but still HbA1c > 48: 
	Start Metformin. Target for adding another drug is 58. 
	If Metformin *not* tolerated, try one of these: 
		- DPP-4 inhibitor (gliptin), or 
		- Pioglitazone, or 
		- Sulfonylurea, or 
			- If instead of Metformin, sulphonylurea is started as 1st drug, target for another drug will be 53 instead of 58.
		- SGLT-2 inhibitor (if [[diabetes- antidiabetic drugs#NICE criteria for SGLT-2|NICE criteria]] met)

If already on one drug, but
	HbA1c 48 - 58: Reinforce advice about Lifestyle modification.
	HbA1c > 58: Add 2nd drug (aka first intensification) and now target: 53. Consider switching or adding treatments with: 
		- DPP-4 inhibitor (gliptin), or 
		- Pioglitazone, or 
		- Sulfonylurea, or 
		- SGLT-2 inhibitor (if [[diabetes- antidiabetic drugs#NICE criteria for SGLT-2|NICE criteria]] met)

If still HbA1c > 58, add another drug from above list (2nd intensification). 
- if they were on Metformin, they'll now be on triple therapy (If someone is on triple therapy, one drug will always be Metformin). 
- If they didn't tolerate Metformin, they'll now be on dual therapy

 If still not controlled 
 - with dual therapy, consider insulin +/- other drugs. 
 - with triple therapy, swap one of them for GLP-1 agonist if: 
	 - BMI >= 35 kg/m2 (adjust accordingly for BAME groups) and specific psychological/medical problems associated with obesity, or
	 - BMI < 35 kg/m2 but:
		 - insulin therapy would have significant occupational implications, or 
		 - weight loss would benefit other significant obesity related comorbidities.

# Treatment based on appropriate drug to use
*See [[diabetes- antidiabetic drugs]].* 
If high risk of CVD/established CVD/HF -> Metformin and once established, add SGLT-2 inhibitor  

If no risk of HF: Metformin 
## Scenario:  
If Metformin not tolerated -> Modified release Metformin.  
If Metformin C/I
- If risk of CVD -> SGLT-2 monotherapy
- If not high risk CVD/no HF -> DPP4 inhibitor/Pioglitazone/Sulfonylurea.
