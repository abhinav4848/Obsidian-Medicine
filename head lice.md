If live head louse is found in a family member, advise detection combing for all contacts. 
Only initiate treatment if when live louse is found. Prophylactic treatment is not recommended. 
Detection combing is done on wet or dry hair with a special comb. 
Wet combing is a method of treatment for confirmed head lice infestation, involving systematically combing the hair over a 2-week period to remove lice.
