| Lower-than-expected levels of HbA1c (due to reduced red blood cell lifespan)                | Higher-than-expected levels of HbA1c (due to increased red blood cell lifespan)                                                                  |

| - Sickle-cell anaemia<br>- GP6D deficiency<br>- Hereditary spherocytosis<br>- Haemodialysis | - Vitamin B12/folic acid deficiency -> cells live longer as they are premature<br>- Iron-deficiency anaemia<br>- Splenectomy -> cells die later. |

HbA1c is unreliable for patients with possible suspected diagnosis of T1DM as it may not accurately reflect a recent rapid rise in serum glucose.
