| Lower-than-expected levels of HbA1c (due to reduced red blood cell lifespan)                | Higher-than-expected levels of HbA1c (due to increased red blood cell lifespan)                                                                  |

HbA1c is unreliable for patients with possible suspected diagnosis of T1DM as it may not accurately reflect a recent rapid rise in serum glucose.
