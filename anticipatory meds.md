Opioids should be used with caution in patients with [[chronic kidney disease]]. 
oxycodone is preferred to morphine in palliative patients with mild-moderate renal impairment  
if renal impairment is more severe, alfentanil, fentanyl, (they're metabolised in the liver & elimination is independent of renal function) buprenorphine are preferred.

# Syringe driver meds
These drugs prefer NaCl 
#mnemonic : Granny KO KO
Granisetron
Ketamine
Octreotide
Ketorolac
Ondansetron

Rest others use water for injection. 

## Real reason for syringe drivers
Syringe driver does not equal end of life. Quite often used in palliative care as an alternative route of drug administration if oral route not possible (or less optimal).  
  
Patches are rubbish for unstable pain.

# Use cases
A 65-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer is reviewed in clinic. Her husband reports that she is increasingly confused and occasionally appears to talk to relatives that are not in the room. She undergoes investigations for reversible causes, of which none are found. If conservative measures fail and she continues to be confused/agitated, what is the most appropriate management? -> Haloperidol.

A 79-year-old female with a history of COPD and metastatic lung cancer is admitted with increasing shortness of breath. Following discussion with family it is decided to withdraw active treatment, including fluids and antibiotics, as the admission likely represents a terminal event. Two days after admission she becomes agitated and restless. What is the most appropriate management? -> s.c. midazolam as it's a terminal event.
