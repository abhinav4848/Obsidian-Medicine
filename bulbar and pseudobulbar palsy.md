Medulla oblongata is called the **bulb**. 
Bulbar nerves are IX, X, XI (cranial part), XII.
Corticobulbar tract is the UMN component that influences the nucleus ambiguus (it's the motor nucleus for 9,10, cranial part of 11) and hypoglossal nucleus (12). 
# Pseudobulbar
Involves the corticobulbar tract which is the UMN component.
Involves X, XI, XII first, and later progress up to pons and involve V, VII. 

UMN condition
- Gag normal/increased, 
- spastic tongue, 
- Jaw jerk increased, 
- spastic dysarthria, 
- labile emotions

# Bulbar
Affects X, XI, XII
Problem is with motor components of bulbar nerves. 

LMN condition
- Gag absent (bovine cough), 
- wasted tongue, fasciculation, 
- Jaw jerk absent, (normal? As V & VII are not part of Bulbar Palsy)
- Nasal speech if b/l palsy, else raspy if u/l palsy 
- Normal emotions, 
- signs in limbs
