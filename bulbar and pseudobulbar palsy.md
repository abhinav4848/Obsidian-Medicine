Medulla oblongata is called the **bulb**. 
Bulbar nerves are IX, X, XI (cranial part), XII.

Corticobulbar tract is the UMN component that influences the nucleus ambiguus (it's the motor nucleus for 9,10, cranial part of 11) and hypoglossal nucleus (12). 
# Pseudobulbar
Involves the b/l corticobulbar tracts which are the UMN component.
Involves X, XI, XII first, and later progress up to pons and involves V, VII. 

UMN condition
- Gag normal/increased, 
- spastic tongue, 
- Jaw jerk increased (due to Vth nerve involvement once lesion goes above bulb and into the pons), 
- spastic dysarthria, 
- labile emotions as UMN involvement

# Bulbar
Here, the problem is with motor components of bulbar nerves. i.e. it affects motor nuclei of X, XI, XII.
*eventually even this extends up to involve V & VII*

LMN condition
- Gag absent (bovine cough), 
- wasted tongue, fasciculation, 
- Jaw jerk normal/diminished (as V & VII are not part of Bulbar Palsy)
- Nasal speech if b/l palsy, else raspy if u/l palsy 
- Normal emotions, 
- signs in limbs
