GH excess due to Pituitary adenoma -> Associated with insulin resistance and DM.

# Mnemonic
ACBDEFG #mnemonic 
1. Acromegaly
2. Blood pressure increase/Large Bowel tumours
3. Cardiomyopathy (LVH)/carpal tunnel syndrome
4. Diabetes mellitus (acanthosis nigricans seen due to insulin resistance)
5. Enlarged viscera
6. Field defects
7. Galactorrhoea
8. Heart Failure/Hypertension  
# Clinical Features
- Bitemporal hemianopia (also seen in hyperprolactinemia. E.g: Pituitary macroadenoma),
- spade like hands,
- enlarged nose & jaw,
- large tongue, prognathism, interdental spaces,
- excessive sweating and oily skin

# Investigation
Screening: IGF-1
	IGF-1 is produced primarily by the liver. Aka Somatomendin C which is a hormone similar in structure to Insulin.  
Definitive: OGTT with serial GH measurement.

Normally, Glucose suppresses GH. In Acromegaly, no suppression.

# Treatment
Cabergoline: Dopamine agonist. Reduce GH secretion.
Octreotide: Somatostatin. Inhibits GH secretion.
Pegvisomant: GH-receptor antagonist
Surgery: trans-sphenoidal resection. 1st choice.

If tumor < 10mm: Cabergoline
If tumor > 10mm: Cabergoline to reduce size, then Surgery

GH is a hyperglycemic hormone. It is stimulated when blood glucose low.
	GH is a contra-insulin hormone. It decreases when insulin increases. Other contra-insulin hormones: Adrenaline, NA, Cortisol, Glucagon.
