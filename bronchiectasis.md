Permanent dilatation of airway 2* to chronic inflammation or infection
[[haemophilus influenzae|HiB]] > Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Strep pneumoniae

# Predisposing features
Patients may have a history of previous infections (e.g. [[Tuberculosis]], measles), bronchial obstruction or ciliary dyskinetic syndromes e.g. Kartagener's syndrome
# Clinical features 
- Chronic cough -> Excessive sputum production
- Fever with shivering, night sweats, patients have dental decay (alcoholics, children)
- Cachexia (weight loss), SOB.
- Coarse crackles, heard in early inspiration in lower zones
- Large airway Ronchi
- Wheeze
## Examination
- Clubbing of fingers (not specific, also seen  in [[lung fibrosis]])
- Percussion: dullness
- Auscultation: Coarse crepitation.
# Investigation
[[Spirometry]]: Obstructive (decreased FEV1/FVC)

Gold standard -> HRCT.
1. Dilatation of the bronchial walls seen as
	1. Tramlines in long axis -> Parallel walls
	2. Signet ring sign-> Bronchial diameter more than accompanying pulmonary artery diameter,
2. Lack of bronchial tapering
3. Bronchial wall thickening
4. Patchy opacities.

Industrial disease-> inform coroner as compensation is available.
