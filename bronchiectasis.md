Gold standard -> HRCT.
1. Dilatation of the bronchial walls seen as
	1. Tramlines in long axis -> Parallel walls
	2. Signet ring sign-> Bronchial diameter more than accompanying pulmonary artery diameter,
2. Lack of bronchial tapering
3. Bronchial wall thickening
4. Patchy opacities.

Industrial disease-> inform coroner as compensation is available.
