# HL
Reed-Sternberg cells (Multinucleated giant cells)  
Bimodal age (<25 or >55) seen in supraclavicular/cervical LN (close proximity)
Involves more central nodes. 
Has [[alcohol]] induced pain. 
(can cause ALL, assoc with [[epstein barr virus|EBV]]. Radiation for HL can lead to NHL. )

# NHL
No RS cells (some other cell morphology may be mentioned).
Age 25-40yo.
Involves peripheral LN (not in close proximity)
Seen in HIV, Rheumatoid arthritis, [[coeliac disease|celiac disease]] #associated 
- MC HIV related lymphoma: NHL (diffuse large B cell lymphoma > Burkitt (caused by [[epstein barr virus|EBV]]))
# Clinical Features
**B Symptoms**: fever, night sweats, weight loss #named 
Hepatosplenomegaly. 
Pancytopenia (bone marrow involved).
There might be mediastinal mass but w/o difficulty breathing

# Diagnosis
Do Excision Biopsy.

# DDX 
#confusion 
- [[toxoplasmosis]]: Splenomegaly, LNE seen but Weight loss not seen.
- EBV causes HL, NHL (Burkitt in HIV), Hairy leukoplakia (HIV). 
- [[epstein barr virus|Infectious Mononucleosis]] vs Lymphoma: sore throat in IM, exudative pus over tonsils, tender tonsils, monospot test +ve, rash after taking ampicillin.
- [[tuberculosis|TB]] has diurnal fever, sweat, weight loss if chronic, tender matted LN (HL has non tender), h/o productive cough, no organomegaly, h/o travel.
- Hodgkin's has normal CBC, because the problem in Hodgkin is outside the bone marrow.
