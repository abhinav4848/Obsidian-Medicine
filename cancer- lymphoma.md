Lymphoma → cancer of lymphocytes that (mostly) form solid tumours in lymph nodes or tissues. 
Leukaemia → cancer of lymphocytes that circulate in blood and bone marrow. 
# HL
Type of cancer originating in the lymphatic system. 

Reed-Sternberg cells (Multinucleated giant cells)  
Bimodal age (<25 or >55) seen in supraclavicular/cervical LN (close proximity)
Involves more central nodes. 
Has [[alcohol]] induced pain. 
(can cause [[leukaemia|ALL]], assoc with [[epstein barr virus|EBV]]. Radiation for HL can lead to NHL. )

# NHL
There are over 60 different types. 
No RS cells (some other cell morphology may be mentioned).
Divided into B cell or T cell lymphomas & subdivided into high grade & low grades. 

Age 25-40yo.
Involves peripheral LN (not in close proximity), spleen, bone marrow, extranodal sites (GI, skin, brain). 
Seen in [[HIV]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[coeliac disease|celiac disease]] #associated 
- MC [[HIV]] related lymphoma: NHL (diffuse large B cell lymphoma > Burkitt (caused by [[epstein barr virus|EBV]]))

A subtype of NHL: MALT can occur in #associated :
- [[sjogren's syndrome]], 
- [[hypothyroidism|Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], 
- [[h. pylori]] (gastric MALT)

# Clinical Features
- **B Symptoms**: fever, night sweats, weight loss #named (more common in HL than NHL)
- Hepatosplenomegaly. 
- Pancytopenia (bone marrow involved).
- There might be mediastinal mass but w/o difficulty breathing
# Diagnosis
Do Excision Biopsy.
## DDX 
#confusion 
- [[toxoplasmosis]]: Splenomegaly, LNE seen but Weight loss not seen.
- EBV causes HL, NHL (Burkitt in HIV), Hairy leukoplakia (HIV). 
- [[epstein barr virus|Infectious Mononucleosis]] vs Lymphoma: sore throat in IM, exudative pus over tonsils, tender tonsils, monospot test +ve, rash after taking ampicillin.
- [[tuberculosis|TB]] has diurnal fever, sweat, weight loss if chronic, tender matted LN (HL has non tender), h/o productive cough, no organomegaly, h/o travel.
- Hodgkin's has normal CBC, because the problem in Hodgkin is outside the bone marrow.

# Richter's transformation
Richter's transformation occurs when [[leukaemia|leukaemia]] (CLL) cells enter the lymph node and change into a **high-grade**, fast-growing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (like DLBCL). Patients often become unwell very suddenly.  
  
Richter's transformation is indicated by one of the following symptoms:  
- lymph node swelling
- fever without infection
- weight loss
- night sweats
- nausea
- abdominal pain
