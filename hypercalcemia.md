Hypercalcemia / Hyperparathyroidism Signs
Hypercalcemia (Normal: 2.1 - 2.6mmol/L)

First sign is drowsiness & increased thirst -> **Excessive thirst** presents with **hypercalcemia** first. Not hyponatremia.

# **Mnemonic**: "Bones, Stones, Groans, Moans"
1. **Painful Bones**: Painful bone condition (Classically osteitis fibrosa cystica). Seen only in primary Hypercalcemia. i.e. [[Hyperparathyroidism]].
2. **Renal Stones**: Kidney Stones (Can ultimately lead to Renal failure), Polyuria, polydipsia. (Hypercalcemia induces [[nephrogenic DI]])
3. **Abdominal Groans**: GI symptoms due to reduced bowel movements from Calcium: Nausea, Vomiting, Constipation, Indigestion
4. **Psychiatric Moans**: Effects on nervous system: lethargy, fatigue, memory loss, psychosis, depression (low mood), confusion

**CVS**: Short QT Interval.

# Etiology:
- Primary [[Hyperthyroidism]] (Associated with increased PTH, Decreased Phosphate). 
- Bone metastasis from Prostate, Breast, etc. 
- SqCC Lung
- Multiple myeloma ([[diff bw Osteoporosis, Pagets, osteomalacia, myeloma, meta, b cell lymphoma, sarcoidosis|ALP is normal]])
- Granuloma: Sarcoidosis/TB/Histoplasmosis -> Sarcoidosis check serum ACE. 
- Vit D intoxication, acromegaly, Thyrotoxicosis, [[Thiazides]], Ca containing antacids, Dehydration, Addison's, Paget's disease of bone

# Investigation:
**H/o of SqCC of lung + Hypercalcemia**
1. First step: Check serum Parathyroid hormone level.
	1. In lung malignancy, serum PTH level would be low -> (this allows us to rule out primary/ tertiary [[hyperparathyroidism]]
2. Then check ALP
	1. If high -> suspect bone metastasis.
	2. So, in lung cancer + high ALP (& high Ca2+) -> Bone metastasis

# High corrected Calcium (increased Ca++):
**Inc. Ca + Inc. ALP**: Bone Metastasis, Thyrotoxicosis or Sarcoidosis.
**Inc. Ca + Inc. Albumin + Inc. Urea**: Dehydration.
**Inc. Ca + Inc. Serum calcitonin**: B-cell lymphoma.

# Treatment
Give iv NS first to excrete Calcium.
	HTN can occur due to hypercalcemia. This does not c/i iv fluid as initial management.
	This is cuz Hypercalcemia causes polyuria -> Dehydration -> Hypovolemia -> Hypernatremia
Then iv Bisphosphonates.
