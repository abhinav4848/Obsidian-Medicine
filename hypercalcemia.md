Hypercalcemia / Hyperparathyroidism 
Hypercalcemia (Normal: 2.1 - 2.6mmol/L)
# Aetiology
- Primary [[Hyperthyroidism]] (Associated with increased PTH, Decreased Phosphate). 
- [[cancers metastasizing to the bone|Bone metastasis]] from Prostate, Breast, etc. 
- [[cancer- lung|Squamous cell carcinoma Lung]]
- Multiple myeloma ([[diff bw Osteoporosis, Pagets, osteomalacia, myeloma, meta, b cell lymphoma, sarcoidosis|ALP is normal]]) 
- Granuloma: [[Sarcoidosis]]/[[tuberculosis|TB]]/Histoplasmosis -> Sarcoidosis check serum ACE. 
- Vit D intoxication, acromegaly, Thyrotoxicosis, [[Thiazides]], Ca containing antacids, Dehydration, Addison's, Paget's disease of bone
# Signs
First sign is drowsiness & increased thirst -> **Excessive thirst** presents with **hypercalcemia** first. Not hyponatremia.

**Mnemonic**: Bones, Stones, Groans, Moans #mnemonic 

| **Condition**             | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Painful Bones**     | Painful bone condition (Classically osteitis fibrosa cystica). Seen only in primary Hypercalcemia. i.e. [[hyperparathyroidism]]. |
| **Renal Stones**      | Kidney Stones (Can ultimately lead to Renal failure), Polyuria, polydipsia. (Hypercalcemia induces [[nephrogenic DI]])           |
| **Abdominal Groans**  | GI symptoms due to reduced bowel movements from Calcium: Nausea, Vomiting, Constipation, Indigestion                             |
| **Psychiatric Moans** | Effects on nervous system: lethargy, fatigue, memory loss, psychosis, depression (low mood), confusion                           |
**CVS**: Short QT Interval.

# Investigation:
**History of [[cancer- lung|Squamous cell carcinoma Lung]] + Hypercalcemia**
1. First step: Check serum Parathyroid hormone level.
	1. In lung malignancy, serum PTH level would be low -> (this allows us to rule out primary/ tertiary [[hyperparathyroidism]]
2. Then check ALP
	1. If high -> suspect bone metastasis.
	2. So, in lung cancer + high ALP (& high Ca2+) -> Bone metastasis

# High corrected Calcium (increased Ca++):
**Inc. Ca + Inc. ALP**: Bone Metastasis, Thyrotoxicosis or Sarcoidosis.
**Inc. Ca + Inc. Albumin + Inc. Urea**: Dehydration.
**Inc. Ca + Inc. Serum calcitonin**: B-cell lymphoma.

# Treatment
Give iv NS first to excrete Calcium.
	HTN can occur due to hypercalcemia. This does not c/i iv fluid as initial management.
	This is cuz Hypercalcemia causes polyuria -> Dehydration -> Hypovolemia -> Hypernatremia
Then iv [[Bisphosphonates]] (zoledronate)
Finally we have Monoclonal antibodies (Denosumab).
