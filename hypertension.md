# Diagnosis
See [NICE CKS Chart](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng136/resources/visual-summary-pdf-6899919517) on [this page](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/hypertension/diagnosis/diagnosis/). 
# Management
See Canvas: [[hypertension management.canvas|hypertension management]]
For Pre-eclampsia, see: [[hypertension in pregnancy]]

# Accelerated HTN
Accelerated (or malignant) hypertension is a severe increase in blood pressure to 180/120 mmHg or higher (and often over 220/120 mmHg) with signs of retinal haemorrhage and/or [[papilledema]] (swelling of the optic nerve). 

## End organ damage
life-threatening symptoms, such as 
- new onset confusion, 
- chest pain, 
- signs of heart failure, 
- or acute kidney injury.

We investigate with 
- CT scan if new onset confusion
- fundoscopy for papilledema/retinal haemorrhage,
- ECG for heart failure, 
- urine dip for proteinuria. 
- U&e for AKI. 

# How to manage a patient in GP with hypertension
- Do 3 readings in the surgery, if coding just one, code the highest reading. 
- if BP is up to stage 2, ask to do a 7-day home BP reading. 
	- if BP stage 3 with no previous noted high BP, go to A&E and optician. 
- Check eGFR, if only an old reading is available, which is not reliable anymore do new set of bloods including Renal function. 
- Also do ECG, [[ckd classification & monitoring|urine ACR]], [[retinopathy|ophthalmoscopy]]. 
	- Can do urine dipstick for RBC & protein
	- ECG for LVH. 
- If starting Ramipril, ask to come back in 3 weeks for a blood test to check eGFR & then do a home BP reading for a week and drop it off prior to the consultation.
- If bloodwork fine, continue with Ramipril. 
- If before starting treatment, you note the most recent eGFR low, start with Amlodipine. 

### If new patient with no previous history of HTN comes with stage 3 HTN
- send to A&E for initial evaluation.
### Known HTN coming back with stage 3 HTN readings
Check for any end-organ damage

# Target for patients
Age > 80yo, target 150/90
If coming for annual monitoring and over age of 60yo, to bring a urine sample
