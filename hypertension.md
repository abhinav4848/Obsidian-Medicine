# Diagnosis
See [NICE CKS Chart](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng136/resources/visual-summary-pdf-6899919517) on [this page](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/hypertension/diagnosis/diagnosis/). 
# Management
See Canvas: [[hypertension management.canvas|hypertension management]]

# Pregnancy
1. Chronic Hypertension
	1. Switch to CCB as [[ace inhibitors|ACE]]- renal agenesis, Beta Blocker- IUGR
	2. Start Aspirin from 12 weeks till delivery if high risk of pre-eclampsia
2. Sudden HTN
	1. iv Labetalol 
	2. iv MgSO4
	3. Delivery when Possible
3. Eclampsia- iv MgSO4 is first line. 
4. DM+ HTN
	1. Give CCB
	2. Consider Aspirin as DM puts patient at high risk of pre-eclampsia. 

## Standard treatment in Pregnancy
Monitor if BP > 140/90.
1. Labetalol if SBP > 150 or DBP > 100.
2. Nifedipine can be used as an alternative if labetalol is contraindicated (e.g. in [[Asthma]]). 
3. Methyldopa is 3rd line.

# Accelerated HTN
Accelerated (or malignant) hypertensionÂ is a severe increase in blood pressure to 180/120 mmHg or higher (and often over 220/120 mmHg) with signs of retinal haemorrhage and/or [[papilledema]] (swelling of the optic nerve). 

## End organ damage
life-threatening symptoms, such as 
- new onset confusion, 
- chest pain, 
- signs of heart failure, 
- or acute kidney injury.

We investigate with 
- CT scan if new onset confusion
- fundoscopy for papilledema/retinal haemorrhage,
- ECG for heart failure, 
- urine dip for proteinuria. 
- U&e for AKI.
