>[!warning]
>Hand dominance prior to 18 months of age is seen to be a red flag sign within development. It can indicate a hemiparesis or be an early sign of cerebral palsy.
>## Other Red Flags:
>- Persistent fisting beyond 3 months
>- Early rolling over, early pulling to a stand instead of sitting, and persistent toe walking may all indicate spasticity.
>- Spontaneous postures, such as scissoring in a child with spasticity or a frog-level position in a hypotonic infant, are important visual clues to motor abnormalities
