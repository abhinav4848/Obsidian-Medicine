# Classification of CKD
[NICE CKS](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/Recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)
Use a combination of GFR & ACR categories & make a KDIGO grid: 

| GFR                                                                      | ACR                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| G1: >90<br>G2: 60-89<br>G3a: 45-59<br>G3b: 30-44<br>G4: 25-29<br>G5: <15 | A1: <3mg/mmol<br>A2: 3 to 30mg/mmol<br>A3: > 30mg/mmol |

Also do a Kidney Failure Risk: https://kidneyfailurerisk.co.uk/ -> Predicts the 2y & 5y probability of ESRF in an individual with stage 3a to 5. So it's not valid if eGFR > 59
### Referral criteria 
Refer if ([NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/Recommendations#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care))
- 5 year risk is > 5% 
- ACR >= 70 mg/mmol, unless known to be caused by diabetes and already appropriately treated
- ACR > 30 mg/mmol (ACR category A3), together with haematuria
- Sustained decrease in eGFR of >= 25% + a change in eGFR category within 12 months
- Sustained decrease in eGFR of >= 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year 
- [[Hypertension]] that remains poorly controlled (above the person's individual target) despite the use of at least 4 antihypertensive medicines at therapeutic doses (see also [NICE's guideline on hypertension in adults](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng136))
- known or suspected rare / genetic causes of CKD 
- suspected renal artery stenosis.
