Affects the scalp ('Cradle cap'), nappy area, face and limb flexures.

Erythematous rash with coarse yellow scales.
## Management  
- reassurance that it doesn't affect the baby and usually resolves within a few weeks
- massage a topical emollient onto the scalp (e.g. Dermol 500), leave overnight to loosen scales, brush gently with a soft brush and wash off with shampoo.
- if severe/persistent a topical imidazole cream may be tried

Although seborrheic dermatitis may involve overgrowth of _Malassezia_ yeasts, and antifungal treatments like ketoconazole shampoo can be effective in more persistent cases, they are not usually necessary for mild to moderate cradle cap in young infants.

Topical corticosteroids are NOT usually advised, although they may be of use for certain infants with nappy rash.
