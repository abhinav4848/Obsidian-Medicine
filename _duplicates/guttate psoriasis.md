*See [[Psoriasis]] for all other types.* 

Guttate psoriasis is a form of acute psoriasis described as a shower of small, pink-red, scaly ‘raindrops’ that has fallen over the body. ([dermnetz](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/guttate-psoriasis))

Guttate psoriasis usually presents with discrete, small, teardop shape (rather than round or oval), pink scaly papules, making it easy to be mistaken for [[Pityriasis rosea]]. 

But guttate psoriasis is preceded by **streptococcal sore throat** 2-4 weeks before (particularly Tonsillitis), and is usually tear shaped rather than oval-shaped. Also Pityrisasis rosea follows lines of Langer.
