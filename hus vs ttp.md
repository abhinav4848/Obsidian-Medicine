# Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
Haematuria after bloody diarrhoea: Diarrhoea that turns bloody 2-3 days later. (E. Coli O157 contaminated food -> Shiga toxin)

Age < 5 yo.
### Clinical Features
#triad 
- Microangiopathic Haemolytic Anaemia*- MAHA- ([[cell histology|helmet cells]]) - Normocytic anaemia & -ve Coomb's test
	- Uraemia (Acute Renal Failure/AKI- [[haematuria]], Proteinuria, Urea, Creatinine, Electrolytes),
- Commonest cause of AKI in children - features are oliguria, peripheral edema.
- [[platelets|thrombocytopenia]] 

(In Renal tubular acidosis, kidney can't absorb HCO3-. Raised creatinine is seen in AKI.)
### Treatment
IV fluids, Blood, Dialysis.

Never give Antibiotics cuz more toxins are released as E coli die. #important 
\*Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (RBC damage due to platelet microthrombi)

----
# TTP
It’s a #pentad: Triad + neurological manifestation + Fever.
ADAMTS 13 factor deficiency/inhibition.
### Treatment
FFP

# Difference
TTP: low adamts13-> abnormal platelet adhesion -> platelet microthrombi formed.

HUS: E coli toxin damage endothelial lining. Platelet microthrombi formed.
