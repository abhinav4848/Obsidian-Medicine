## Notes on topical steroids %%(is transcluded)%%
Using topical steroids in [[plaque psoriasis]].  
- as we know topical corticosteroid therapy may lead to skin atrophy, striae and rebound symptoms 
    - the scalp, face and flexures are particularly prone to steroid atrophy so topical steroids should not be used for more than 1-2 weeks/month 
- systemic side-effects may be seen when potent corticosteroids are used on large areas e.g. > 10% of the body surface area 
- NICE recommend that we aim for a 4-week break before starting another course of topical corticosteroids
- they also recommend using potent corticosteroids for no longer than 8 weeks at a time and very potent corticosteroids for no longer than 4 weeks at a time

For [[eczema]]
Should be used on red or itchy areas of skin
- They should be applied at least 15 minutes after the moisturiser has been applied (some patients put their moisturiser on early evening and steroid on at bedtime)
- Please watch a video on how to apply steroids using the fingertip method (refer to section at bottom)
- You may be provided with two steroid creams – a milder one that can be used more often if needed, and a stronger one that can be used for a few days if the eczema flares (gets worse)
- In general, less steroid cream should be used on areas of thinner skin, e.g., the face, the body folds, genitalia and in older patients the lower legs

### Topical Steroid withdrawal
If you have been using higher strength TS for some weeks, you should wean yourself off slowly (reducing the TS strength and/or frequency of application) and not stop suddenly. If you stop topical steroids and develop a skin rash different from what you had before, this may be TSW.
