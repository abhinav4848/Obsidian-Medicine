COPD- need influenza vaccine. 
MRC score > 3 need pulmonary rehab. 

# From NICE CKS 
- Stop smoking
- One off pneumococcal vaccine + annual influenza vaccine
- [[asthma- drugs|SABA/SAMA]] (first line)
- If ✅[[asthma|asthmatic]] features suggesting steroid responsiveness -> LABA + ICS
	- If still breathless/have exacerbations:
		- Triple therapy: LAMA + LABA + ICS
	- Continue SABA/SAMA prn. Discontinue SAMA if taking LAMA. 
- If ❌No asthmatic features -> +LABA + LAMA
	- If already taking SAMA, switch to SABA
	- if severe, can add ICS 3 month trial -> no relief then stop
- Oral theophylline after all else fails.

Pulmonary rehabilitation to all people who view themselves as functionally disabled by COPD (usually Medical Research Council >= MRC grade 3)

# Asthmatic Features 
- any previous, secure diagnosis of asthma or of atopy
- Raised eosinophil count.
- substantial variation in [[spirometry|FEV1]] over time (at least 400 ml)
- substantial diurnal variation in PEF (at least 20%)

# Room for prophylactic Azithromycin 
- No smoking, optimised treatment but still exacerbations
	- Not recommended for people who still smoke. 
- CT thorax excluded Bronchiectasis
- Sputum culture excluded Atypical infections & TB
- LFT, ECG to exclude [[qt prolongation]] as Azithromycin #abx can cause.

# PDE-4 inhibitor (e.g.: roflumilast) 
- Reduces COPD risk in severe cases having frequent exacerbations 
- Give if **severe COPD**
	- FEV1 < 50% after bronchodilator 
	- >=2 exacerbations in last 12 months despite triple therapy
# Rescue Pack
Standby medication: NICE recommend offering a short course of oral corticosteroids and oral antibiotics to keep at home if: 
- have had an exacerbation within the last year
- understand how to take the medication, and are aware of associated risks and benefits
- know to when to seek help and when to ask for replacements once medication has been used
# Cor pulmonale 
- Peripheral edema, raised JVP, systolic parasternal heave, Loud P2
- Use loop diuretic for edema, consider [[copd|LTOT]]
- Don't use- ACE-inhibitors, CCB and alpha-blockers.
