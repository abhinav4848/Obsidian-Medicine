# From NICE CKS 
Stop [[smoking]] (including nicotine replacement, varenicline or bupropion)
One off pneumococcal vaccine + annual influenza vaccine #vaccine

- Start with Bronchodilator therapy: [[asthma- drugs|SABA/SAMA]] (first line)
- If ✅ \*[[asthma|asthmatic]] features suggesting steroid responsiveness -> Add on LABA + ICS
	- If still breathless/having exacerbations:
		- Triple therapy: LAMA + LABA + ICS
	- Continue SABA/SAMA prn. Discontinue SAMA if taking LAMA. 
- If ❌ No \*asthmatic features -> +LABA + LAMA
	- If already taking SAMA, switch to SABA
	- if severe, can add ICS 3 month trial -> no relief then stop
- Oral theophylline after all else fails (done by specialist)
	- dose should be reduced if macrolide or fluoroquinolone antibiotics are co-prescribed

Pulmonary rehabilitation to all people who view themselves as functionally disabled by COPD (usually [[mrc dyspnoea scale|Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale]] >= grade 3)

**Frequent Exacerbation**: Defined as >=2 exacerbations in the last 12 months despite being on triple inhaled therapy (LAMA + LABA + ICS). 

# \*Asthmatic Features 
- any previous, secure [[asthma- diagnosis|diagnosis of Asthma]] or of atopy
- Raised eosinophil count.
- substantial variation in [[spirometry|FEV1]] over time (at least 400 ml). 
- substantial **diurnal** variation in PEF ([[asthma- diagnosis#Second line investigation|at least 20%]]). 
- Don't do BDR now as it can be misleading as per NICE. 

# Room for prophylactic Azithromycin 
- No smoking, optimised treatment but still exacerbations
	- Not recommended for people who still smoke. 
- CT thorax excluded [[Bronchiectasis]] 
- Sputum culture excluded Atypical infections & [[tuberculosis|TB]] 
- LFT, ECG to exclude [[qt prolongation]] as Azithromycin #abx can cause. 

# PDE-4 inhibitor (e.g.: roflumilast) 
- *Started by respiratory clinic*. Patients benefit most when they have a chronic productive cough which is consistent with a chronic bronchitic phenotype. This type particularly benefits from PDE-4 inhibitors. ([NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA461/chapter/1-Recommendations))
- PDE-4 inhibitor reduces COPD exacerbation in severe cases having frequent exacerbations 
- Given if **severe COPD**: 
	- FEV1 < 50% predicted after bronchodilator 
	- **Frequent Exacerbation**: Defined as >=2 exacerbations in the last 12 months despite being on triple inhaled therapy (LAMA + LABA + ICS). 
# Rescue Pack
aka Standby medication: NICE recommend offering a short course of oral corticosteroids and oral antibiotics to keep at home if: 
- have had an exacerbation within the last year
- understand how to take the medication, and are aware of associated risks and benefits
- know when to seek help and when to ask for replacements once medication has been used. 
# Lung volume reduction surgery
Lung volume reduction surgery is suggested when there's upper-lobe predominant emphysema or hyperinflation on imaging (i.e. Emphysematous lung destruction)- both are prerequisites for surgical evaluation. 

# LTOT
[[long term oxygen therapy]]
