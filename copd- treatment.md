# From NICE CKS 
- Stop smoking
- One off pneumococcal vaccine + annual influenza vaccine
- [[asthma- drugs|SABA/SAMA]]
- If ✔[[asthma|asthmatic]] features suggesting steroid responsiveness -> LABA + ICS
	- If still breathless/have exacerbations:
		- Triple therapy: LAMA + LABA + ICS
	- Continue SABA/SAMA prn
- If ❌No asthmatic features -> +LABA + LAMA
	- If already taking SAMA, switch to SABA
	- if severe, can add ICS 3 month trial -> no relief then stop
- Oral theophylline after all else fails.

# Asthmatic Features 
- any previous, secure diagnosis of asthma or of atopy
- Raised eosinophil count.
- substantial variation in [[spirometry|FEV1]] over time (at least 400 ml)
- substantial diurnal variation in PEF (at least 20%)

# Room for prophylactic Azithromycin 
- No smoking, optimised treatment but still exacerbations
- CT thorax excluded Bronchiectasis
- Sputum culture excluded Atypical infections & TB
- LFT, ECG to exclude QT prolongation as Azithromycin can cause.

# PDE-4 inhibitor (e.g.: roflumilast) 
- Reduces COPD risk in severe cases having frequent exacerbations 
- Give if
	- FEV1 < 50% after bronchodilator
	- >=2 exacerbations in last 12 months despite triple threapy

# Cor pulmonale 
- Peripheral edema, raised JVP, systolic parasternal heave, Loud P2
- Use loop diuretic for edema, consider LTOT
