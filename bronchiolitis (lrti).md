Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) mostly. 
It is an [[infection in children|LRTI]]. 


>[!Video]-
>![Severe RSV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOrty5PfhTY)
>-  Nasal flaring mostly occurs in infants and young children; the nostrils widen while breathing in.
>- When your child is pulling the chest in at the ribs, below the breastbone, or above the collarbones, this is called retracting.
>- Grunting is a sound made by a baby or young child who is having trouble breathing. By grunting, a child tries to keep air in the lungs to help build up the oxygen level.
>- Normally, a newborn breathes 30-60 times per minute. When your baby breathes faster, which is called tachypnea, this is another sign for respiratory distress.
# Clinical Features
Seen in < 1yo.
- coryzal prodrome over 1-3 days 
- then 
	- persistent cough, 
	- tachypnoea ([[fever & sepsis|sepsis]])/chest recession, 
		- fever in some cases (but less than 39C)
	- Expiratory [[Abnormal airway sounds|wheeze]] ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RU_bysa5Lc)) / fine crackles on auscultation 
- Difficulty feeding and breathing
### When to Admit
>[!danger] Admit a child with: 
> - apnoea (observed or reported)
> - child seriously unwell
> - severe respiratory distress, for example 
> 	- Grunting, 
> 	- marked chest recession, or 
> 	- RR > 70 breaths/minute ([[resp & heart rate in children|tachypnoea]])
> - central cyanosis
> - persistent oxygen saturation of less than 92% when breathing air.

>[!warning] Consider referral if:
>- RR > 60
>- difficulty with breastfeeding or inadequate oral fluid intake (50-75% of usual volume 'taking account of risk factors and using clinical judgement')
>- clinical dehydration.
## Confusion
- < 2 years: bronchiolitis, but > 2 years: [[Asthma]]
- Wheeze is seen in [[Asthma]] and bronchiolitis. It's a feature of LRTI.
- Wheeze is not seen in pneumonia. 
- Pneumonia would have focal crackles and fever > 39C
## Treatment
- Supportive care even if severe:
	- **Humidified O2**,
	- NGT if child not feed.
- Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody #abx which is used to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children who are at increased risk of severe disease.
## Patients at Risk
Those at risk of developing RSV include
1. Premature infants
2. Infants with lung or heart abnormalities
3. Immunocompromised infants
