# Bipolar disorder 
It's a mood disorder.
**Medications**: Lithium, quetiapine
# Interactions
Addition of [[depression|antidepressants]] (sertraline, etc.) can worsen [[Mania]].

ACEi, ARB, Diuretics and NSAIDs can lead to [[lithium|Lithium toxicity]].
- Acetazolamide increases Lithium excretion.
- Lithium + [[Amiodarone]] worsens ventricular arrhythmia.

# Monitoring
- Before starting [[lithium]], measure TFT, U&e (liTHium-> THyroid function test #mnemonic )
- Amiodarone: U&e. 

Patients on lithium should have their lithium levels checked 3 monthly & TSH & renal function checked at least 6 monthly.

Test lithium 12 hrs. after last dose.
