# Emergency Contraceptives
- Levonorgestrel (Levonelle 1500mcg) and Ulipristal acetate (EllaOne) are progesterone-only emergency contraceptives that can be used after [[time for action of contraceptives|day 21 postpartum]].
- Both can be used more than once during a menstrual cycle. Don’t combine them (no concomitant use).
- After ovulation, only IUD is reliable.

# Levonelle (Levonorgestrel 1.5mg)
- Use within 72 hrs (can be used upto 96hrs with low efficacy) -> Prevents ovulation and implantation.
- Hormonal contraception can be started immediately after taking levonelle for emergency contraception.
- Vomiting occurs in 1%. If vomiting occurs within 3 hours, repeat dose.
- Doubling dose: 
	- The dose should be doubled for those with a BMI >26 or weight over 70kg
	- Dose should also be doubled if taking enzyme-inducing drugs (although a copper IUD as emergency contraception is preferable in this situation)

# EllaOne (Ulipristal)
- Use within 120 hrs -> Prevents ovulation.
- Ulipristal may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraception. Contraception with the pill, patch or ring should be started, or restarted, 5 days after having ulipristal. Barrier methods should be used during this period.
- ==breastfeeding should be delayed== for one week after taking ulipristal. There are no such restrictions on the use of levonorgestrel.
- Caution in ==severe [[asthma]]==.
# IUCD
- Use within 120 hrs of UPSI.
- if a woman presents after more than 5 days of UPSI, then an IUD may be fitted up to 5 days after the likely ovulation date
- is 99% effective regardless of where it is used in the cycle.
- It prevents fertilisation (prevent sperm from reaching the egg), but even if that has occurred, can prevent implantation.
