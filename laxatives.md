# Types of laxatives
## Bulk-forming laxatives
Fibre, psyllium, ispaghula husk (Fybogel), methylcellulose (Celevac). 
These absorb water in the bowel and swell to bulk out the stool. This increases faecal mass making it softer and easier to pass, and stimulates peristalsis. 
Patients should increase fluid intake. 
Many ill patients will not tolerate a high fibre diet or bulk forming laxatives and these are not usually recommended in palliative care.

First line in pregnancy. 
## Emollient stool softeners 
Sodium Docusate
Decrease the surface tension of faecal mass (surface wetting agent) and increases intestinal fluid in the stool, lubricating it, thus making it easier to pass.
It's only approved for bowel obstruction. 
Also has stimulant action at higher doses. 
Onset: 1-3 days. 

## Osmotic laxatives
Lactulose (esp in [[cirrhosis]]), Macrogols (cosmocol, movicol, laxido), and Magnesium sulphate/hydroxide. 
Draw fluid into the bowel and soften stools.
Can lead to abdominal cramps, N/V/D. 
Macrogol preparations may be preferable to lactulose if additional softener is required.

>[!info]
>Lactulose is used to treat **hepatic encephalopathy** as it reduces the intestinal production and absorption of ammonia.

Lactulose is sickly sweet taste and needs ++fluids. Don't give in patients with inadequate fluid intake. Many patients at the end of life are not able to drink enough, causing colicky pain and little, if any, result for all osmotic laxatives. 
Laxido/Movicol need +fluid (125ml/sachet); and are good for faecal impaction. 

Macrogol Onset: 1-2 days. 
Lactulose Onset: 
## Stimulant laxatives
Senna, Bisacodyl (Dulcolax), Sodium Picosulfate
Promote contraction of the intestines, promoting the movement of stools through the bowel when patient is too weak to defecate.
Do not use if patient has complete bowel obstruction.
Senna Onset 6 -12 hrs. 
Bisacodyl Onset 10 -12 hrs. 

Picosulfate is preferred in palliative settings as it does not need much fluids and people who have lost their appetite and are struggling to drink, will not be able to take the amount of fluid Laxido etc needs. 
Picosulfate onset: 6 –14 hours

## Peripherally acting Mu opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs)
[Link](https://www.westmidspallcare.co.uk/wmpcp/guide/constipation/choice-of-laxatives/)

Opioid receptors are present in the gastrointestinal tract. When opioids bind to these receptors they can disrupt normal gastrointestinal function, resulting in opioid-induced constipation. PAMORAs do not cross the blood brain barrier, so relieve the constipation without preventing the analgesic effect of opioids. Caution is recommended if the blood brain barrier is disturbed e.g. severe dementia.
They're licensed for opioid induced constipation where other laxative has been tried. 
- Methylnaltrexone s.c. injection: Specialist use only recommended. Onset of action: Can be rapid (within 30min); median time 1–6h.
- Naloxegol tablet: Onset of action: Median time 5–21h. Only use as monotherapy. 
- Naldemedine tablet: Onset of action: Median time 5–18h

# Indications
### Short term constipation
**Step 1**: Start bulk-forming laxative
**Step 2**: Add or switch to an osmotic laxative
**Step 3**: Add stimulant laxative

### Opioid-induced constipation
**Step 1**: Start osmotic laxative and stimulant laxative
**Step 2**: Add softener laxative
**Step 3**: Naloxegol (mechanism: opioid receptor antagonist)

### Faecal impaction
For patients with **faecal impaction** (i.e. retention of faeces to the extent that spontaneous evacuation is unlikely), consider oral macrogol/oral stimulant laxative depending on stool consistency.

If there is an inadequate response to oral laxatives, consider **rectal administration** of bisacodyl/glycerol.

### Chronic constipation
For patients with **chronic constipation** (constipation symptoms for at least three months):
**Step 1**: Start bulk-forming laxative
**Step 2**: Add or change to osmotic laxative
**Step 3**: Add stimulant laxative

# Rectal preparations
Base it on what kind of faecal load (soft or hard stool) is present. 

Soft loading
- Bisacodyl suppository (stimulant, in contact with bowel wall): Acts in 20-60 mins
- Phosphate enema (high)
- Micralax (smaller dose overall)

Hard loading
- Glycerol suppository (softener, stimulant), then treat as above- Acts in 1-6 hrs. 

Softeners- Give at night (retention enema)
- Arachis oil enema (don't use in those with peanut allergy). Warm before use. 
- Docusate enema. Acts in 15-60 mins. Give at night (retention enema). 

Osmotic agents (rectal)
Phosphate enema- Ensure patient is hydrated and recent U&e have been taken. Acts in 15-60 mins. 128ml enema. 
Sodium Citrate enema- Acts in 15-60 mins. Start at 5ml enema.

Cosmocol & Sodium picosulfate is given in [[inflammatory bowel disease|Crohn's disease]] as it constricts the bowel.
