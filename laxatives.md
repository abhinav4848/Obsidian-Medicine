# Types of laxatives
## Bulk-forming laxatives
Fibre, psyllium, ispaghula husk (Fybogel), methylcellulose (Celevac). 
These absorb water in the bowel and swell to bulk out the stool. This increases faecal mass making it softer and easier to pass, and stimulates peristalsis. 
Patients should increase fluid intake. 

First line in pregnancy. 
## Emollient stool softeners 
Sodium Docusate
Decrease the surface tension of faecal mass and increase intestinal fluid in the stool, lubricating it, thus making it easier to pass.
It's only approved for bowel obstruction. 

## Osmotic laxatives
Lactulose (esp in [[cirrhosis]]), Macrogols (cosmocol, movicol, laxido), and Magnesium sulphate/hydroxide. 
Draw fluid into the bowel and soften stools.
Can lead to abdominal cramps, N/V/D. 

>[!info]
>Lactulose is used to treat **hepatic encephalopathy** as it reduces the intestinal production and absorption of ammonia.

Lactulose is sickly sweet taste and needs ++fluids. 
Laxido/Movicol need +fluid (125ml/sachet); and are good for faecal impaction. 
## Stimulant laxatives
Senna, Bisacodyl (Dulcolax), Sodium Picosulfate
Promote contraction of the intestines, promoting the movement of stools through the bowel.

Picosulfate is preferred in palliative settings as it does not need much fluids and people who have lost their appetite and are struggling to drink, will not be able to take the amount of fluid Laxido etc needs.

# Indications
### Short term constipation
**Step 1**: Start bulk-forming laxative
**Step 2**: Add or switch to an osmotic laxative
**Step 3**: Add stimulant laxative

### Opioid-induced constipation
**Step 1**: Start osmotic laxative and stimulant laxative
**Step 2**: Add softener laxative
**Step 3**: Naloxegol (mechanism: opioid receptor antagonist)

### Faecal impaction
For patients with **faecal impaction** (i.e. retention of faeces to the extent that spontaneous evacuation is unlikely), consider oral macrogol/oral stimulant laxative depending on stool consistency.

If there is an inadequate response to oral laxatives, consider **rectal administration** of bisacodyl/glycerol.

### Chronic constipation
For patients with **chronic constipation** (constipation symptoms for at least three months):
**Step 1**: Start bulk-forming laxative
**Step 2**: Add or change to osmotic laxative
**Step 3**: Add stimulant laxative

# PR Interventions
Base it on what kind of faecal load (soft or hard stool) is present. 

Soft loading
- Bisacodyl suppository (stimulant, in contact with bowel wall)
- Phosphate enema (high)
- Micralax (smaller dose overall)

Hard loading
- Glycerol suppository (softener), then treat as above.

Cosmocol & Sodium picosulfate is given in [[_inflammatory bowel disease|Crohn's disease]] as it constricts the bowel.
