#### COCP & Cancer risk
COCP ==increases== risk for [[cancer- breast (treatment)|Breast Cancer]] & [[cancer- cervical|Cervical Cancer]], Fibroid, Cervical ectropion.
- E promotes cervical epithelial proliferation -> Facilitates persistent HPV infection
- E&P causes breast cell proliferation. 

COCP ==decreases== risk for [[cancer- endometrial|Endometrial Cancer]] & [[cancer- ovarian|Ovarian cancer]], [[cancer- colorectal|Colorectal cancer]].
- P counteracts E & causes endometrial thinning. 
- E&P suppresses ovulation

OCP: *[[cancer- ovarian|Ovarian cancer]] protection*. #mnemonic 
- Because OCP  suppresses ovulations. As well as pregnancy does same.

# Drugs used to treat Gynae cancers
See [[cancer- breast (treatment)|Breast Cancer]]. 
## Tamoxifen
- **Anti-Estrogenic action on**: Breast (reduces ER+ve tumor size), Peripheral sites (hot flushes)
- **Estrogenic action on**: Endometrium (proliferation), Bone (Anti-resorptive), Plasma lipid (reduces Chl), Blood (VTE)
## Raloxifene
- **Anti-Estrogenic action on**: Breast (reduces tumour size), Endometrium (No proliferation)
- **Estrogenic action on**: Bone (Anti-resorptive), Plasma lipid (reduces Cholesterol), Blood (Increase VTE)
	- Can be given for postmenopausal [[osteoporosis]] ([BNF](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/raloxifene-hydrochloride/)) but still Bisphosphonates will be first line. 
## Summary
Both reduce Breast cancer, protect bone, keep lipid low. 
Both increase risk of VTE. 
Tamoxifen causes Endometrial Ca, Raloxifene doesn't.
