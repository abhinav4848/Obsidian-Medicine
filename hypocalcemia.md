*See [[hypercalcemia]].*
causes- Tingling, numbness, paresthesia, involuntary spasm.
# Causes
- Osteomalacia (vit D deficiency)
- Chronic renal failure due to impaired conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active form (e.g. in DM-> nephropathy -> CRF -> Hypocalcemia, Hyper PO), so Acute renal failure will not have hypocalcemia. 
	- Hypocalcemia can then lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism.
- Post thyroidectomy when PTH accidentally removed.
- Hypomagnesemia
- HyperPO4- (decreased PTH causes increase PO4)
- Panic attack -> Hyperventilation -> respiratory alkalosis -> transient hypocalcemia.
	- High H+ accompanies high Ca++. So acidosis is hypercalcemia.

# c/f
SPASMODIC: #mnemonic Spasm, perioral paresthesia, anxious, seizures, muscle tone increased in smooth muscle, orientation impairment (time, place, person)/confusion, dermatitis, impetigo herpetiformis, Chvostek's sign #named , cardiomyopathy ([[QT prolongation]]), trousseau's sign #named 

**Chvostek**: twitch of facial muscles when tap over parotid
**Trousseau**: wrist flexion when brachial artery occluded.
