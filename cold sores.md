Primary attacks of Type 1 [[human herpes viruses|HSV]] infections occur mainly in infants and young children. In crowded, underdeveloped areas of the world, nearly all children have been infected by the age of 5. 

Cold sores should start to heal within 10 days, but are contagious and may be irritating or painful while they heal. 

No restriction for [[school in children with rash|school]]. 
*Compare with [[Impetigo]]: Red sores or blisters on the face that become crusty, golden-brown patches*
