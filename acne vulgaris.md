Occurs in adolescence
- Androgen levels are normal however. 
- Blackhead is caused by plug within the pilosebaceous duct expanding to dilate (and block) the pilosebaceous orifice and gradually becoming extruded (exposed) -> inflammation leads to papules, pustules, nodules.
- Severity of acne is directly related to the degree of secretion of sebum -> sebaceous gland becomes blocked.
- Anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes.
# Treatment
Benzoyl peroxide used especially if papules and pustules are present. 
### Mild-Mod
12 weeks of topical FDC (fixed dose combination) 
- adapalene (retinoid) + benzoyl peroxide (brand: Epiduo 0.1% or 0.3% + 2.5% gel. Apply OD in evening), or
- [[retinoids|tretinoin]] + clindamycin (brand: Treclin gel), or
- benzoyl peroxide + clindamycin (brand: Duac. Use OD)

Any topical retinoid or BPO can be used on its own if combination products are not tolerated, or patient prefers to avoid retinoids/abx
### Mod-Severe
12 weeks FDC of topicals as above, or
- Topical azelaic acid + either oral lymecycline 408mg or oral doxycycline 100mg
	- (both contraindicated in pregnancy and children under 12 years of age)
##### Notes  
- If not suitable for Lyme or Doxy, 2nd line is Clarithromycin, or an oral macrolide
	- Erythromycin can be used in pregnancy. 
	- Children under 12 years of age: Clarithromycin (dose dependent on weight) is the only drug that can safely be used in Primary Care
- 3rd line: [[Trimethoprim]] (warn about cutaneous reaction)
- Instead of abx, COCP can be considered in suitable women. 
- Patients should be advised on sun protection if using oral tetracyclines and topical retinoids as both increase photosensitivity. 
### Severe
Refer all severe cases to Specialists.
Prescribe treatment as above while awaiting appointment.

# Other tips
## Women
1. Avoid tetracycline in [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|Pregnant]]/Breastfeeding/children < 12years. Use Erythromycin.
2. Avoid topical/oral retinoids in pregnancy.
3. COCPs are an alternative to oral Abx in women. Use them in combination with topical agents. Should contain 30mcg oestrogen + either NE or LNG
	- Co-Cyprindiol (Dianette): 2nd line after other OCPs have failed. It has anti-androgen properties, but increased VTE risk compared to other COCPs. (it's only licensed for acne with contraception needs ([BNF](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/co-cyprindiol/)). Not individually for either). 
	- Due to the increased risk of VTE with Co-Cyprindiol (Dianette), it should be discontinued 3-4 cycles after acne has cleared, and should not be used just for contraception. Can switch to other OCPs.
	- Oral POP contraceptives or progestin implants with androgenic activity may exacerbate acne. Acne is a known s/e of POP. Third and fourth-generation COCP are generally preferred.
## Others
1. Treatment with oral Abx to be used for max. 6 months regardless of route of administration of abx (topical or oral). Initial course of 3 months. [NICE Follow up](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/acne-vulgaris/management/primary-care-management/#follow-up) 
	1. If completely cleared: stop abx but continue topical 
	2. If improved but not cleared: Extend abx by another 3 months
2. Adding topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO)/topical retinoid to someone already receiving oral antibiotics can reduce the risk of resistant Propionibacterium acnes.
3. Do not use the following to treat acne: 
    1. Monotherapy with a topical antibiotic.
    2. Monotherapy with an oral antibiotic.
    3. A combination of a topical antibiotic and an oral antibiotic.
4. Give Oral [[retinoids|isotretinoin]]: only under specialist supervision
5. High dose Oral [[Trimethoprim]] for Gram -ve folliculitis that develops with long term antibiotic use. [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|Don't give in T1]].
# Referral
- the following patients should be referred to a dermatologist:
    - patients with acne conglobata: a rare and severe form of acne found mostly in men that presents with extensive inflammatory papules, suppurative nodules (that may coalesce to form sinuses) and cysts on the trunk.
    - patients with nodulo-cystic acne
- referral should be _considered_ in the following scenarios:
    - mild to moderate acne has not responded to two completed courses of treatment
    - moderate to severe acne has not responded to previous treatment that includes an oral antibiotic
    - acne with scarring 
    - acne with persistent pigmentary changes
    - acne is causing or contributing to persistent psychological distress or a mental health disorder
