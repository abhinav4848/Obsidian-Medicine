Occurs in adolescence
- Androgen levels are normal however. 
- Blackhead is caused by plug within the pilosebaceous duct expanding to dilate (and block) the pilosebaceous orifice and gradually becoming extruded (exposed) -> inflammation leads to papules, pustules, nodules.
- Severity of acne is directly related to the degree of secretion of sebum -> sebaceous gland becomes blocked.
- Anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes.

# Other tips
## Women
1. Avoid tetracycline in [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|Pregnant]]/Breastfeeding/children < 12years. Use Erythromycin.
2. Avoid topical/oral retinoids in pregnancy.
3. COCPs are an alternative to oral Abx in women. Use them in combination with topical agents.
	- Co-Cyprindiol (Dianette): has anti-androgen properties, but increased VTE risk compared to other COCPs. (Only licensed for acne with contraception needs ([BNF](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/co-cyprindiol/)). Not individually for either).
	- Due to the increased risk of VTE with Co-Cyprindiol (Dianette), it should be discontinued 3-4 cycles after acne has cleared, and should not be used just for contraception. Can switch to other OCPs.
## Others
1. Treatment option with oral Abx to be used for max. 6 months. Regardless of route of administration of abx (topical or oral), initial course of 3 months, extended by another 3 months only if good response.
2. Adding topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO)/topical retinoid to someone already receiving oral antibiotics can reduce the risk of resistant Propionibacterium acnes.
3. Topical and Oral Abx not to be used in combination.
4. Give Oral [[retinoids|isotretinoin]]: only under specialist supervision
5. High dose Oral Trimethoprim for Gram -ve folliculitis that develops with long term antibiotic use. [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|Don't give in T1]].
