Risk factor for colorectal cancer, prostate cancer: Age > Family history.
Incidence increases after age 35yo and rises rapidly after age 50, peaking in 70s.
Most cancers develop from adenomatous polyps. 
# Clinical Features
Rectal bleeding, Change in bowel habit (mostly [[diarrhoea]]), occult bleed leading to anaemia, abdo pain, weight loss, malaise. 

Cecum is most common site. 
# Tests
- Raised FIT will then be confirmed with colonoscopy.
- All newly diagnosed patients should have CEA ([[tumour marker]]) for staging & then monitoring after treatment.
- [[cancer- screening programs|FIT]] is also useful for patients with new symptoms who do not meet the 2ww criteria.

Faecal occult blood test (FOBT) has been replaced by FIT.
# Criteria for referral to 2WW
1. >=40 + unexplained weight loss AND abdominal pain
2. >=50 + unexplained rectal bleeding
3. >=60 + iron-deficiency anaemia OR change in bowel habit
4. faecal tests are positive

Those outside the 2ww can be considered. 

FIT should be offered to:
- >= 50 + unexplained weight loss OR abdominal pain
- < 60 + iron deficiency anaemia OR changes in their bowel habit
- >= 60 + anaemia even in the absence of iron deficiency

## High anterior resections 
are when the anastomosis is above the peritoneal reflection (i.e. for distal sigmoid, rectosigmoid and upper rectal tumours).

## Low anterior resection 
is where the anastomosis is below the peritoneal reflection.
