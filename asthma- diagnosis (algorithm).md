#Triad: Chest tightness, Sob, Wheezing.
Others: Nocturnal cough, Exercise induced wheeze, family history of asthma. 

# Suspecting asthma
[NICE topics asthma](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/asthma/diagnosis/diagnosis/)
**Suspect a diagnosis of asthma if a person presents with:**
- **Variable symptoms of wheeze, noisy breathing, cough, breathlessness, and/or chest tightness.**
	- Symptoms are commonly episodic and variable over time and in intensity (may be worse at night, on waking, or seasonal).
	- Symptoms may be [triggered](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/asthma/background-information/risk-factors-triggers/) or exacerbated by exercise, laughter, crying, viral respiratory tract infection, environmental source of their symptoms (e.g. mould in the home, changes in temperature or humidity i.e. cold/damp air, smokers or indoor air pollution, pet hair), or use of NSAIDs or beta-blockers, pet hair.
- **Expiratory polyphonic wheeze on examination** (may be absent or only heard on forced expiration).
	- Be aware that even if examination is normal, a person may still have asthma.
**Suspect a diagnosis of occupational asthma if a person of working age has:**
- New symptoms suggestive of asthma, reappearance of childhood asthma, deteriorating asthma control, or unexplained airflow obstruction, _and_
- They are employed in a [high-risk job](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/asthma/background-information/risk-factors-triggers/), _and/or_
- Asthma symptoms are better away from work or on holidays.

# Diagnose Asthma in Adults
NICE has adopted a stepwise approach to diagnostic testing: you do a test; if it is positive, asthma is confirmed and no further testing is needed; if it is negative, you proceed to the next test, and so on.
>[!Notice]- Algorithm
>![[diagnose asthma in people over 16yo.jpg]]
## First line investigation
Measure eosinophil count OR Fractional Nitric Oxide ([[asthma- investigations#Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)|FeNO]])
Can diagnose asthma without further investigations if:
- Eosinophil above reference range
- FeNO >= 50ppb. 
## Second line investigation
If asthma not confirmed by above tests, 
- Measure bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) with [[spirometry]]. Diagnose asthma if:
	- FEV1 increases >=12%, **AND** >=200ml from pre-BD measurement, or
	- FEV1 increases >=10% of predicted normal FEV1
- If BDR not available, do PEF (peak expiratory flow) twice daily for 2 weeks. Diagnose asthma if:
	- PEF Variability (expressed as 'amplitude percentage mean') > 20%  seen after monitoring at least BD for 2-4 weeks. 
## Third line
If asthma still not confirmed with Eosinophil count, FeNO, BDR, PEF variability but still suspected on clinical grounds:
- Refer for consideration of [[asthma- investigations#Bronchial challenge test|Bronchial challenge test]] - Diagnose asthma if bronchial hyper-responsiveness is present.

# Diagnose asthma in children aged 5-16yo
>[!Notice]- Algorithm
>![[diagnose asthma in ages 5-16yo.jpg]]

FeNO >= 35ppb

If level not raised, or test can't be done: 
- BDR with spirometry
If no spirometry
- PEF twice daily for 2 weeks

If still not confirmed by FeNO, BDR, PEF, but still suspected
- skin prick test to house dust mite, OR
- measure total IgE + eosinophil count.
Exclude asthma if no sensitisation to house dust mite, OR if total serum IgE not raised. 
Diagnose asthma if evidence of sensitisation OR a raised IgE & eosinophil count >0.5x10^9/L

If still doubt, [[asthma- investigations#Bronchial challenge test|Bronchial challenge test]].

# Suspected asthma in children under 5
The guidelines acknowledge the difficulty of performing tests in such young children. They suggest: [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#objective-tests-for-diagnosing-asthma-in-adults-young-people-and-children-aged-5-to-16-with-a:~:text=Diagnosis%20is%20hard%20in%20this%20age%20group%20because%20it%20is%20difficult%20to%20do%20the%20tests "NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)") *(completely transcribed below)*
- treating with inhaled corticosteroids as per the pharmacological management guidelines with regular review
	- See [[asthma- new management 2024#Asthma Management < 5yo linked|management]]
- if they still have symptoms at age 5 then attempt objective tests
	- If not able to do test at age 5, try again in 6-12 months
- refer to a specialist respiratory paediatrician:
	- If child's asthma is not responding to treatment. 
	- any preschool child with an admission to hospital, or 2 or more admissions to an emergency department, with wheeze in a 12-month period.
