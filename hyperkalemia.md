# Causes
Drugs like ACE-, ARB, & Spironolactone can cause. Also, NSAID can cause hyperkalemia.
	[[_side effects of cvs drugs|Thiazides]] cause hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hyperuricemia ([[Gout]]), metabolic alkalosis

Can occur due to AKI/ARF (low eGFR) which can itself be due to HF.
	E.g.: crackle at lung, sacral edema -> HF.
		Donâ€™t give iv fluid cuz there's already fluid overload.

[[addison's disease|Addison's]]
Acidosis
Rhabdo
Massive blood transfusion

# Severity
Mild (5.5-5.9)
Moderate: (6-6.4)
Severe (>= 6.5)

# Treatment
If mild or moderate with no ECG changes
Stop the offending drug.

## If (Moderate + ECG changes), or if Severe
1st: calcium gluconate/CaCl2 to protect cardiac membrane
Then reduce serum K+ by insulin + dextrose/Salbutamol inhalation.
	10 units insulin in 50ml of 50% glucose iv perfusion over 30 minutes.

As this solution is temporary, IV NS needs to be given if not HF patient.
If fluid overload, start/increase loop diuretics (furosemide) or give Ca Resonium.

## If very Severe (>=7.5) + Acute renal failure + Anuria
give hemodialysis.

**Note**: Salbutamol inhalation can also be used. But never seen it as the right option.
