# Risk factors for gestational diabetes
- BMI of > 30 kg/mÂ²
- previous macrosomic baby weighing 4.5 kg or above
- previous GDM
- first-degree relative with DM
- family origin with a high prevalence of DM (South Asian, [[afro-caribbean|black Caribbean]] and Middle Eastern)

# Screening for GDM
- OGTT is test of choice
- H/o prev. GDM: OGTT soon after booking & at 24-28 weeks if the first test is normal.
- Early self-monitoring of blood glucose is an alternative to the OGTTs.
	- Targets for self monitoring of pregnant women (pre-existing & GDM)

| Time               | Target      |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Fasting            | 5.3 mmol/l  |
| 2 hour after meals | 6.4 mmol/l  |
| 1 hour after meals | 7.8 mmol/l, |
- Any of the other risk factors should get OGTT at 24-28 weeks.

# Diagnostic thresholds for GDM
GDM is diagnosed if either:

| Fasting     | >= 5.6 mmol/L |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 2 hour OGTT | >= 7.8        |

See [[diagnosing diabetes mellitus]]

# Management of GDM

| Fasting glucose | Treatment                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|                 | Glibenclamide if can't tolerate metformin or decline insulin treatment                                                                                                                                           |
| 6-6.9 mmol/l    | Only if there is evidence of complications such as macrosomia or hydramnios -> insulin                                                                                                                           |
| < 7 mmol/l      | - Trial of diet and exercise.<br>- If no control in 1-2 weeks, metformin.<br>- If no control, insulin should be added to diet/exercise/metformin<br>- GDM is treated with short-acting, not long-acting, insulin |
| >=7 mmol/l      | Insulin                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

# Management of pre-existing DM
- weight loss for women with BMI of > 27 kg/m^2
- stop oral hypoglycaemic agents, apart from metformin, and commence insulin
- folic acid 5 mg/day from pre-conception to 12 weeks gestation
- detailed anomaly scan at 20 weeks including four-chamber view of the heart and outflow tracts
- tight glycaemic control reduces complication rates
- treat retinopathy as can worsen during pregnancy
