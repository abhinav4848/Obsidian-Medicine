Postmenopausal vaginal bleed.
	But most common causes for postmenopausal bleeds: Atrophic vaginitis (seen post-coitally)

All women >55 with post menopausal bleed: 2 WW pathway.
	Do initial TVS for thickness > If thick (>4mm), do diagnostic Hysteroscopy + Endometrial Biopsy

**Progesterone, [[cancer- drugs involved in gynae cancers#COCP & Cancer risk embedded|COCP]] reduces risk.**
# Risk Factors
Oestrogen increases risk: E.g.: Unopposed HRT, Early menarche, Late menopause, Nulliparity. 
- Oestrogen only HRT: If removing LNG-IUD because contraception is no longer needed, check that the woman isn't also using it as part of HRT. 
- If women are using HRT regime that separates the two hormones (e.g. transdermal oestrogen & oral micronised progesterone), ensure she's requesting both regularly, rather than just oestrogen. 

Obesity (high BMI), PCOS, DM, age

[[cancer- drugs involved in gynae cancers|Tamoxifen]] (used for Rx Breast cancer. It opposes oestrogen in breast but acts like oestrogen in uterus. Prevent bone loss.)- Women are advised to report any bleeding concerns early. 

# Endometrial hyperplasia
Pre-malignant condition. 
Hyperplasia w/o atypia -> <5% progression to endometrial cancer. Reversible risk factors (obesity) should be managed. Use continuous oral progesterone/LNG IUS. 

Hyperplasia with atypia -> More likely to progress to cancer. Hysterectomy advised +/- b/l salpingo-oopherectomy. 
# Treatment
[[cancer- drugs involved in gynae cancers|Raloxifene]] antagonist on breast & uterus. Agonist on bone.
