*aphthous is Greek derived meaning mouth ulcer.* 

recurrent mouth ulcers. 
can be an early manifestation of a systemic disease like [[Behcet's disease]]. 
can happen in [[inflammatory bowel disease|IBD]]. 

# Who can get
People with recurrent ulcers may have a genetic predisposition. 
A positive family history can be found in up to 40% of people.

Precipitating factors include:  
- Oral trauma (for example excessive tooth brushing).
- Anxiety or stress
- Certain foods (typically chocolate, coffee, peanuts, almonds, strawberries, cheese, tomatoes, and wheat flour).
- Stopping [[smoking]].
- Hormonal changes related to the menstrual cycle.
# More common in
- Women 
- People under 40 years of age 
- Non-smokers 
	- Smoking causes the mouth lining to become thicker (keratinized) and mildly suppresses the immune response, reducing ulcer formation. Non-smokers lack this protective effect, so ulcers occur more easily.
- People of high socioeconomic status 
# When to investigate
Investigations are generally unnecessary. 
Investigations should be considered (e.g. FBC, ESR, ferritin, folate and vitamin B12) if an underlying systemic disease is suspected based on history and examination findings. 
# Management
- Avoidance of precipitating factors, and
- Symptomatic treatment for pain, discomfort, and swelling e.g. a short course of a low potency topical corticosteroid (hydrocortisone lozenges), an antimicrobial mouthwash, or a topical analgesic.
- ==People with a mouth ulcer that persists for more than 3 weeks should be referred urgently to a specialist.== #important
