# Indication
- prevention and treatment of [[osteoporosis]]
- [[hypercalcemia|hypercalcaemia]]
- [[paget's disease of bone]] 
- pain from bone metastases
# Treatment
![[osteoporosis#Treatment of Osteoporosis (is linked)]]

# Alendronate dosage
10mg OD, or 70mg once weekly. 
No monthly regimen. 

How to take:
- Take on empty stomach
- Sit upright -> Stay seated for 30 mins
- Take with whole glass of plain water
- Swallow tablet. Don’t suck/chew.
Don’t take calcium & vit D for 4 hrs after Alendronic acid. 

If esophagitis, review -> Risk of oropharyngeal ulcers.
Dyspepsia common in first month. 
## Review of alendronate usage
##### Duration of usage
The duration of bisphosphonate treatment varies according to the level of risk. 
- Low risk of #: review after 3-5 years
- High risk: Take at least for 10 years.

Some authorities recommend stopping bisphosphonates at 5 years if the following apply:  
- patient is < 75-years-old
- femoral neck T-score of > -2.5  (see [[osteoporosis]])
- low risk according to FRAX/NOGG
# Adverse effects
- Oesophageal reactions: advise patients to sit/stand upright when taking it. For 30 mins before food.
- **Osteonecrosis of jaw**: More common in patients receiving iv bisphosphonates for cancer treatment than patients receiving oral for [[osteoporosis]]/[[paget's disease of bone|Paget's]]. Patients should have dental checkup before bisphosphonate treatment. 
- increased risk of atypical stress fractures of the proximal femoral shaft in patients taking alendronate
- acute phase response: fever, myalgia and arthralgia may occur following administration
- [[hypocalcemia]]: due to reduced calcium efflux from bone. Usually clinically unimportant.
	- So Hypocalcemia/Vit D deficiency should be corrected before bisphosphonates started.

# Why stand/sit up?
Q: How does an empty stomach help prevent heartburn with bisphosphonates, but this is opposite advice to NSAIDs?

A: It's because they're poorly absorbed so need to be on an empty stomach to try and optimise absorption. Think it's probably a double edged sword of poorly absorbable and irritative to stomach/oesophagus hence the standing up advice

# In Palliative setting with high calcium
- zoledronate over 4 hrs. Shows effect in few days. 
- Also used for [[cancers metastasizing to the bone|bone pain due to mets]].
