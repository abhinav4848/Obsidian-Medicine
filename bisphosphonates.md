# Why stand/sit up?
Q: How does an empty stomach help prevent heartburn with bisphosphonates, but this is opposite advice to NSAIDs?

A: It's because they're poorly absorbed so need to be on an empty stomach to try and optimise absorption. Think it's probably a double edged sword of poorly absorbable and irritative to stomach/oesophagus hence the standing up advice
