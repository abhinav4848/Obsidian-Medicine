Hypocalcaemia/vitamin D deficiency should be corrected before giving bisphosphonates. 
When starting bisphosphonate treatment for [[osteoporosis]], calcium should only be prescribed if dietary intake is inadequate. Vitamin D supplements are normally given. 

# Adverse effects
- Oesophageal reactions: advise patients to sit/stand upright when taking it. For 30 mins before food.
- Osteonecrosis of jaw: More common in patients receiving iv bisphosphonates for cancer treatment than patients receiving oral for [[osteoporosis]]/[[Paget's]]

# Why stand/sit up?

A: It's because they're poorly absorbed so need to be on an empty stomach to try and optimise absorption. Think it's probably a double edged sword of poorly absorbable and irritative to stomach/oesophagus hence the standing up advice
