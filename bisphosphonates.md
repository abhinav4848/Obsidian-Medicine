- Hypocalcaemia/vitamin D deficiency should be corrected before giving bisphosphonates. 
	- Zoledronate and denosumab both suppress osteoclast activity. If calcium intake/absorption is already low due to vitamin D deficiency, serum calcium can drop dangerously once bone resorption is blocked. 
- When starting bisphosphonate treatment for [[osteoporosis]], [[osteoporosis#Calcium Supplementation (is linked)|Calcium]] should only be prescribed if dietary intake is inadequate. 
	- [[vitamin-d]] supplements are normally given. 
# Alendronate dosage
10mg OD, or 70mg once weekly. 
No monthly regimen. 

How to take:
- Take on empty stomach
- Sit upright -> Stay seated for 30 mins
- Take with whole glass of plain water
- Swallow tablet. Don’t suck/chew.
Don’t take calcium & vit D for 4 hrs after Alendronic acid. 

If esophagitis, review -> Risk of oropharyngeal ulcers.
Dyspepsia common in first month. 

## Review of alendronate usage
Low risk of #: review after 3-5 years
High risk: Take at least for 10 years.

# Adverse effects
- Oesophageal reactions: advise patients to sit/stand upright when taking it. For 30 mins before food.
- **Osteonecrosis of jaw**: More common in patients receiving iv bisphosphonates for cancer treatment than patients receiving oral for [[osteoporosis]]/[[paget's disease of bone|Paget's]]. 

# Why stand/sit up?
Q: How does an empty stomach help prevent heartburn with bisphosphonates, but this is opposite advice to NSAIDs?

A: It's because they're poorly absorbed so need to be on an empty stomach to try and optimise absorption. Think it's probably a double edged sword of poorly absorbable and irritative to stomach/oesophagus hence the standing up advice

# In Palliative setting with high calcium
- zoledronate over 4 hrs. Shows effect in few days. 
- Also used for [[cancers metastasizing to the bone|bone pain due to mets]].
