# Aetiology
Physis: means growth plate. 

The proximal femoral physis weakens causing the femoral metaphysis to ‘slip’ leading to deformity and altered mechanics of the hip joint. 
##### Warning
>[!Warning]
>![[sufe.png]]
>Any child (especially in the adolescent age) presenting with knee pain should have a hip examination and, if necessary, hip x-rays to rule out SUFE.
