*See [[prostate]] for other prostate problems.* 

## Risk factors
Age > 50
Family history
[[afro-caribbean|African American]] male. 

# Investigation
Initial test: Digital rectal exam, PSA
	3/4th of raised PSAs are normal. 
Diagnostic: Multiparametric MRI has replaced TRUS Biopsy.  
	In the absence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, the absence or presence of prostate capsule invasion is a major determinant as to whether the patient is offered curative or non-curative therapy. 
	CT is not sensitive enough to diagnose subtle extracapsular extension.
	Extracapsular extension of tumour is shown accurately with MRI. 
But if not confirmed, then they do trans-perineal biopsy

# Treatment
GnRH analogue (e.g. Leuprolide, Goserelin): Used in continuous manner to work as antagonist.
