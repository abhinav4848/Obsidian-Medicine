Something extra I learned from endocrine consultant who gets referrals after primary care has tried sildenafil & tadalafil:
- Do a 9am testosterone. 
- 20mg vardenafil once a week for 8 weeks.
- Go into a room and use whatever's material needed to stimulate yourself. Do it without a partner. 
- First 5 tablets don't have much effect but the 6/7/8 tablets do the trick.
- Only after this do you refer.
