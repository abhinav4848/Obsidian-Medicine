Blepharitis is inflammation affecting both upper and lower lid margins causing
1. Irritation, grittiness,
2. [[sticky eye]],
3. burning sensation and
4. crusting around lashes
especially upon waking up.

*The meibomian glands secrete oil on to the eye surface to prevent rapid evaporation of the tear film. Any problem affecting the meibomian glands (as in blepharitis) can hence cause drying of the eyes which in turns leads to irritation.* 

Tear drops (only aqueous based) will only cause minimal relief because lack of oily secretion from meibomian gland will still cause tears to dry.

It's often associated with skin conditions like seborrheic dermatitis, [[Acne Rosacea]] or infestation with *Demodex* mites
