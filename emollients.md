- Emollients are 1st line for [[eczema]]. 
	- #Mnemonic: Apply emollients before [[steroids in dermatology|steroids]] (E comes before S). 
	- Emollients should be applied first and allowed to dry for 15-20 minutes before applying the topical steroid sparingly.
- From least (absorbs better) to most greasy: Lotion > Cream > Ointment 
- Emollients are the 1st line management for flare ups as well.

| Type                                            | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Lotions** – high water content                | Absorbed quickly, spreads easily, minimal greasiness and no staining. However less effective, can have alcohol base which can sting, can contain irritants and are not routinely recommended. |
| **Creams** – water and oil mixture              | ==Absorbed quickly and well tolerated==. However can contain irritants.                                                                                                                       |
| **Gels** – light oils, water and gelling agents | Slightly greasier than creams and easily absorbed. However some are expensive.                                                                                                                |
| **Sprays** – lipids and oils                    | Easy to use and apply to difficult to reach areas or where skin is very tender. However are expensive.                                                                                        |
| **Ointments** – highest oil/paraffin content    | ==Most effective== and contain fewest preservatives. However can stain clothing and are less well tolerated.                                                                                  |
| **Bath and shower oils**                        | Can be added to the bath water or directly to the skin in the shower. However can cause bath or shower to become slippery and some creams/ointments can be used instead.                      |
Dermol is good for soap substitution but prefer not to use it as a leave-on moisturiser, as it has antibiotics in it, that can lead to irritant contact dermatitis (Benzalkonium chloride, Chlorhexidine dihydrochloride)

For your leave-on moisturiser, switch to a bland, simple emollient that does not contain any antimicrobial agents or other potential irritants like fragrances. Good alternatives for a leave-on moisturiser include Cetraben Cream, Doublebase gel, or Epaderm Ointment.
