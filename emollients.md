- Emollients are 1st line for [[eczema]]. 
	- #Mnemonic: Apply emollients before [[steroids in dermatology|steroids]] (E comes before S). 
	- Emollients should be applied first and allowed to dry for 15-20 minutes before applying the topical steroid sparingly.
- From least (absorbs better) to most greasy: Lotion > Cream > Gel > Ointment 
- Emollients are the 1st line management for flare ups as well.

| Type                                            | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Lotions** – high water content                | Absorbed quickly, spreads easily, minimal greasiness and no staining. However less effective, can have alcohol base which can sting, can contain irritants and are not routinely recommended. |
| **Creams** – water and oil mixture              | ==Absorbed quickly and well tolerated==. However can contain irritants.                                                                                                                       |
| **Gels** – light oils, water and gelling agents | Slightly greasier than creams and easily absorbed. However some are expensive.                                                                                                                |
| **Sprays** – lipids and oils                    | Easy to use and apply to difficult to reach areas or where skin is very tender. However are expensive.                                                                                        |
| **Ointments** – highest oil/paraffin content    | ==Most effective== and contain fewest preservatives. However can stain clothing and are less well tolerated.                                                                                  |
| **Bath and shower oils**                        | Can be added to the bath water or directly to the skin in the shower. However can cause bath or shower to become slippery and some creams/ointments can be used instead.                      |
Balneum has [[urea]] and is used for itch & as an emollient. 
##### Dermol 
Dermol 500: Good for soap substitution but prefer not to use it as a leave-on moisturiser, as it has antibiotics in it, that can lead to irritant contact dermatitis.
1. Antimicrobials: Benzalkonium chloride, Chlorhexidine dihydrochloride
2. Emollients: Liquid paraffin, Isopropyl myristate
For the occasional patient, who gets frequent skin infections, the use of a specific anti-septic emollient may be beneficial e.g. Dermol 600 Bath Emollient or Dermol 200 Shower Emollient, and Emulsiderm Liquid Emulsion. Dermol can occasionally irritate the skin if used too often, in which case it can be used once or twice a week
##### Leave on moisturisers
For your leave-on moisturiser, switch to a bland, simple emollient that does not contain any antimicrobial agents or other potential irritants like fragrances. Good alternatives for a leave-on moisturiser include Cetraben Cream, Doublebase gel, or Epaderm Ointment. 
##### Skin sensitisers 
Some emollients contain potential skin sensitisers such as lanolin, preservatives fragrances and sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). Ointments contain fewer potential irritants than creams and lotions.
