- Emollients are 1st line for [[eczema]]. 
	- #Mnemonic: Apply emollients before [[steroids in dermatology|steroids]] (E comes before S). 
	- Emollients should be applied first and allowed to dry for 15-20 minutes before applying the topical steroid sparingly.
- From least (lease oil, absorbs better) to most greasy (most oil): Lotion > Cream > Gel > Ointment 
- Emollients are the 1st line management for flare ups as well.

| Type                                            | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lotions** – high water content                | Absorbed quickly, spreads easily, minimal greasiness and no staining. However less effective, can have alcohol base which can sting, can contain irritants and are not routinely recommended. |
| **Creams** – water and oil mixture              | ==Absorbed quickly and well tolerated==. However can contain irritants.                                                                                                                       |
| **Gels** – light oils, water and gelling agents | Slightly greasier than creams and easily absorbed. However some are expensive.                                                                                                                |
| **Sprays** – lipids and oils                    | Easy to use and apply to difficult to reach areas or where skin is very tender. However are expensive.                                                                                        |
| **Ointments** – highest oil/paraffin content    | ==Most effective== and contain fewest preservatives. However can stain clothing and are less well tolerated.                                                                                  |
| **Bath and shower oils**                        | Can be added to the bath water or directly to the skin in the shower. However can cause bath or shower to become slippery and some creams/ointments can be used instead.                      |
##### Leave on moisturisers
- For your leave-on moisturiser, switch to a bland, simple emollient that does not contain any antimicrobial agents or other potential irritants like fragrances. Good alternatives for a leave-on moisturiser include Cetraben Cream, Doublebase gel, or Epaderm Ointment. 
##### Skin sensitisers 
- Some emollients contain potential skin sensitisers such as preservatives, fragrances (lanolin, limonin, linolul), and sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS- foaming agent). Ointments contain fewer potential irritants than creams and lotions. 
- Don't use Antibacterial/antiseptic emollients as leave on

		For the occasional patient, who gets frequent skin infections, the use of a specific anti-septic emollient may be beneficial e.g. Dermol 600 Bath Emollient or Dermol 200 Shower Emollient, and Emulsiderm Liquid Emulsion. Dermol can occasionally irritate the skin if used too often, in which case it can be used once or twice a week
