- Emollients are 1st line for [[eczema]]. 
	- #Mnemonic: Apply emollients before [[corticosteroid#Topical steroid preparations|steroid]] (E comes before S). 
- From least (absorbs better) to most greasy: Lotion > Cream > Ointment 
- Emollients are the 1st line management for flare ups as well.

Dermol is good for soap substitution but prefer not to use it as a leave-on moisturiser, as it has antibiotics in it, that can lead to irritant contact dermatitis (Benzalkonium chloride, Chlorhexidine dihydrochloride)

For your leave-on moisturiser, switch to a bland, simple emollient that does not contain any antimicrobial agents or other potential irritants like fragrances. Good alternatives for a leave-on moisturiser include Cetraben Cream, Doublebase gel, or Epaderm Ointment.
