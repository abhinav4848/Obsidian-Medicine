- examination reveals a purplish, oedematous, tender subcutaneous perianal mass
- can present with bleeding if hematoma spontaneously bursts.
- if patient presents within 72 hours then referral should be considered for excision. Otherwise patients can usually be managed with stool softeners, ice packs and analgesia. Symptoms usually settle within 10 days.
