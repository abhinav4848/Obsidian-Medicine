Haemorrhoids can cause pain, itching and bleeding. Although grades 2-4 can reveal a rectal mass, these are normally red or flesh coloured.

# Clinical features
Splash in pan, young person-> haemorrhoids -> Proctoscopy

If blood in stool over the age of 55yo, suspect [[cancer- colorectal|colorectal cancer]] -> Do Sigmoidoscopy, Colonoscopy

*see [[cancer- screening programs]]*

## Treatment
The first-line therapy for haemorrhoids is to soften stools and increase dietary fibre

**Sitz baths** are a form of hydrotherapy where the patient sits in warm water up to their hips. While they can provide temporary relief from symptoms such as itching, burning or discomfort associated with haemorrhoids, they do not address the underlying issue of increased pressure on the anal cushions due to hard stools and straining.

**Topical nitrates**, such as GTN ointment, are used in treating chronic anal fissures rather than haemorrhoids. They work by relaxing the internal anal sphincter muscle, thereby improving blood flow to the area and promoting the healing of fissures. However, they don't directly address the issue of hard stools and straining seen in haemorrhoids.

# Thrombosed Haemorrhoids
- typically present with acutely painful and tender lump
- examination reveals a purplish, oedematous, tender subcutaneous perianal mass
- can present with bleeding if hematoma spontaneously bursts.
- if patient presents within 72 hours then referral should be considered for excision. Otherwise patients can usually be managed with stool softeners, ice packs and analgesia. Symptoms usually settle within 10 days.
## Treatment
Anugesic (combined topical hydrocortisone & pramocaine) is the best short term symptomatic treatment for a thrombosed haemorrhoid.
