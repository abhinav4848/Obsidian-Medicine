It's AR inheritance. #genetics 
Cortisol low + Aldosterone low + Androgen Excess.
Vomiting, Weight Loss, Lethargy, Dehydration, low Na+, high K+
# Mnemonic
#mnemonic 
If deficient enzyme starts with 1, it causes hypertension;
if deficient enzyme ends with 1, it causes virilization in females
- [[precocious puberty]] in males.
- Commonest form of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia is 21-alpha hydroxylase deficiency.
# Neonatal features
It may present in neonates and children with the following features: 
**Female**
	Ambiguous genitalia 
**Male**
	Penile Enlargement, Hyperpigmentation, testes small (so they're not the cause for androgen -> Adrenal is.)
**Infant Male**
	Salt Wasting (due to Aldosterone deficiency)
- -> Vomiting, Weight Loss, Lethargy, Dehydration, low Na+, High K+
- (11-B-Hydroxylase Deficiency)
- If this is the stem, we order -> Aldosterone level

# Adult Features
**Males** -> No signs, may be hyperpigmentation (due to high MSH)

**Females** -> [[Hirsutism]] (androgen dependent excessive hair growth in the face, chest, back), Acne, Early pubarche, Oligomenorrhea (due to high 17-hydroxyprogesterone that is converted into androgens; testosterone, androstenedione).

# Investigations
17-hydroxyprogesterone (it's high due to 21-Hydroxylase deficiency)

Remember that polycystic ovarian syndrome ([[PCOS]]) is different:
	Inability to conceive (infertility) + Obesity + Acne + LH high
	Order USG pelvis.
