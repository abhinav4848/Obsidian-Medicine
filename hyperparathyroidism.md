# CKD & PO4
PTH is phosphaturic -> prevents resorption, but kidneys must excrete PO4 first for PTH to even prevent resorption-> CKD kidneys can't excrete PO4 so all calcium gets used up in Ca3(PO4)2.

Kidneys synthesize Vit D.

Remember that 10% of Primary Hyperparathyroidism have normal PTH but low PO4.

**Rx**: for Primary hyperthyroidism: Parathyroidectomy.
If patient can't tolerate surgery, Cinacalcet

# Types of Hyperparathyroidism

| Hyperparathyroidism | Note                                                                                                                                          | PTH         | Calcium                                                            | PO4         | Vit D    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Primary             | Commonest cause is PTH adenoma. High Ca should cause low PTH, but PTH staying normal means primary.<br><br>  <br>(→ osteitis fibrosa cystica) | Normal/High | [[hypercalcemia\|High]] (polydipsia, polyuria)<br><br>+ Raised ALP | Low         | N/low    |
| Secondary           | High PTH due to existing Hypocalcemia, especially secondary to CKD                                                                            | High        | Low/normal                                                         | High/normal | Very low |
| Tertiary            | End stage renal failure                                                                                                                       | Very high   | High                                                               | High        | N/Low    |
