**CKD & PO4**
PTH is phosphaturic -> prevents resorption, but kidneys must excrete PO4 first for PTH to even prevent resorption-> CKD kidneys can't excrete PO4 so all calcium gets used up in Ca3(PO4)2.

Kidneys synthesize Vit D.

Remember that 10% of Primary Hyperparathyroidism have normal PTH but low PO4.

**Rx**: for Primary hyperthyroidism: Parathyroidectomy.
If patient can't tolerate surgery, Cinacalcet
