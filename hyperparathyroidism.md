# CKD & PO4
PTH is phosphaturic -> prevents resorption, but kidneys must excrete PO4 first for PTH to even prevent resorption-> CKD kidneys can't excrete PO4 so all calcium gets used up in Ca3(PO4)2.

Kidneys synthesize Vit D.

Remember that 10% of Primary Hyperparathyroidism have normal PTH but low PO4.

**Rx**: for Primary hyperthyroidism: Parathyroidectomy.
If patient can't tolerate surgery, Cinacalcet

# Vit D can unmask hyperparathyroidism %%(is transcluded)%%
Calcium levels should be monitored after commencing [[vitamin D]] because it can unmask underlying hyperparathyroidism- [[hypercalcemia|hypercalcaemia]] can occur. 
- If someone is primary hyper-parathyroid and profoundly low Vit D, they won't manifest a rise in calcium because of this massively low Vit D. 
	- Low Vit D can also cause compensatory secondary Hyperparathyroidism. 
- When you supplement Vit D, secondary hyperparathyroidism should normalise. 
- But the primary hyperparathyroidism can raise the calcium freely- i.e. it's unmasked. 
# Types of Hyperparathyroidism

# Treatment
if mild primary hyperparathyroidism -> advise to increase fluid to prevent stones. Avoid Thiazides/high calcium intake. 

Cinacalcet (a ‘calcimimetic’) -> increases sensitivity of parathyroid cells to Ca2+ (so less PTH secretion); mainly indicated for management of symptomatic hyperparathyroidism in those not fit for surgical intervention.
