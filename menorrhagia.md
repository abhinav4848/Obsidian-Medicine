IUD (copper) is a cause. 
IUS ([[contraceptives|Mirena]]) is a treatment.

Once all [[contraceptives for bleeding reduction|underlying pathologies]] ruled out, management depends on need for contraception.
##### If yes: 
- 1st line: LNG IUS (Mirena)
- 2nd line: COCP (can be used in dysmenorrhea as 2nd line)
- 3rd line: Long acting progestogens ([[contraceptives|Depo Provera]])
##### If no:
- Mefenamic acid: it's an NSAID (Menorrhagia + dysmenorrhea 1st line)
- Tranexamic acid (Menorrhagia) 
	- Don't combine tranexamic acid with COCP or Mirena.

Both can be started on first day of periods.

Norethisterone 5 mg TDS can be used as a short-term option to rapidly stop heavy menstrual bleeding.
