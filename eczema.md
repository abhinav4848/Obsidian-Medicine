Disease of the dry skin. Throw moisture at the dry skin and that helps. 

URTI can flare up eczema.

Eczema is a common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder. 
- The skin function is impaired leading to porous and dry skin that easily becomes inflamed, susceptible to infection and itchy. 
- Chronically scratched skin may become thickened (lichenified)

Eczema is an Itchy rash on flexures & skin creases. (wrist, palms, elbow folds, behind the knees).
- **In infants**: face, trunk, extremities.
- **In younger children**: extensor surfaces.

### Difference with psoriasis
[[Psoriasis]] is on extensor, Eczema in adults is flexor.
Psoriasis has well defined borders but not Eczema.
Eczema & Psoriasis are relapsing in nature. 

# Clinical Features
- **Mild**: Dry skin, infrequent itching, small areas of redness
- **Moderate**: Dry skin, frequent itching, redness, +/- excoriation
- **Severe**: Dry skin, Very frequent itching, redness, excoriation, extensive skin thickening, bleeding, interfere with eating & sleep

# Treatment
Avoid triggers- soaps, or anything that bubbles/lathers, cigarette smoke, irritant clothing. 

## Emollients
- Emollients are 1st line for eczema. 
	- #Mnemonic: Apply emollients before steroids (E comes before S). 
- From least (absorbs better) to most greasy: Lotion > Cream > Ointment 
- Emollients are the 1st line management for flare ups as well.

Dermol is good for soap substitution but prefer not to use it as a leave-on moisturiser, as it has antibiotics in it, that can lead to irritant contact dermatitis (Benzalkonium chloride, Chlorhexidine dihydrochloride)

For your leave-on moisturiser, switch to a bland, simple emollient that does not contain any antimicrobial agents or other potential irritants like fragrances. Good alternatives for a leave-on moisturiser include Cetraben Cream, Doublebase gel, or Epaderm Ointment.

## Steroids 
> [!Topical Steroids] 
> Apply thinly for short duration. Mostly rely on
> - **Mild strength**: Hydrocortisone acetate 0.5, 1, or 2.5% ([Daktacort](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/hydrocortisone-with-miconazole/medicinal-forms/))
> - **Moderate strength**: Betamethasone valerate (0.025%), Clobetasone (Eumovate)
> - **Potent strength**:
> 	- Betamethasone valerate (0.1%) (Betnovate),
> 	- Mometasone (0.1%)-> For severe eczema not responding to emollients and hydrocortisone.
> 	- Hydrocortisone Butyrate
> - Very potent: Clobetasol propionate (0.5%) aka Dermovate
> - #Mnemonic: HEBDO -> Hydrocortisone > Eumovate > Betnovate > Dermovate > Oral
- If eczema awakens the patient at night, consider sedative anti-histamines (Chlorpheniramine)
- Treat bacterial infection with oral antibiotic.

## Topical Calcineurin inhibitor
Topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. tacrolimus, brand Protopic) can be used as steroid-sparing agents and are typically second-line treatment for eczema.

Useful on delicate/steroid-sensitive areas, such as the face, eyelids, and flexures, where prolonged topical steroid use risks skin atrophy.
