Disease of the dry skin. Throw moisture at the dry skin and that helps. 

URTI can flare up eczema.

Eczema is a common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder. 
- The skin function is impaired leading to porous and dry skin that easily becomes inflamed, susceptible to infection and itchy. 
- Chronically scratched skin may become thickened (lichenified)

Eczema is an Itchy rash on flexures & skin creases. (wrist, palms, elbow folds, behind the knees).
- **In infants**: face, trunk, extremities.
- **In younger children**: extensor surfaces.

### Difference with psoriasis
- [[Psoriasis]] is on extensor, Eczema in adults is flexor.
- Psoriasis has well defined borders but not Eczema.
- Eczema & Psoriasis are relapsing in nature. 

# Clinical Features
- **Mild**: Dry skin, infrequent itching, small areas of redness
- **Moderate**: Dry skin, frequent itching, redness, +/- excoriation
- **Severe**: Dry skin, Very frequent itching, redness, excoriation, extensive skin thickening, bleeding, interfere with eating & sleep

# Treatment
Avoid triggers- soaps, or anything that bubbles/lathers, cigarette smoke, irritant clothing. 
## Emollients
[[emollients]]
## Steroids 
See: [[steroids in dermatology]]. 
![[steroids in dermatology#Easy memorisation of topical steroids linked]]
- If eczema awakens the patient at night, consider sedative anti-histamines (Chlorpheniramine)
- Treat bacterial infection with oral antibiotic. 
## Topical Calcineurin inhibitor 
Topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. tacrolimus, brand Protopic) can be used as steroid-sparing agents and are typically second-line treatment for eczema.

Useful on delicate/steroid-sensitive areas, such as the face, eyelids, and flexures, where prolonged topical steroid use risks skin atrophy. 
# Safety net
- Recognise a flare: A ‘flare’ is a worsening of the eczema. Skin may become red, sore, (more) itchy, crack or bleed. 
- Recognise infected eczema: it could be infected and your child may need antibiotics
	- If skin suddenly worsens, 
	- weeps (fluid oozing from skin) or crusts (yellow)
	- swollen & painful skin
	- Feeling hot, shivery, unwell
