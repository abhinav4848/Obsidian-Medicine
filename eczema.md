Itchy rash on flexures & skin creases. (wrist, palms, elbow folds, behind the knees).
URTI can flare up eczema.

**In infants**: face, trunk, extremities.
**In younger children**: extensor surfaces.

Psoriasis is on extensor, Eczema in adults is flexor.
Psoriasis has well defined borders but not Eczema.
Eczema & Psoriasis are relapsing in nature.

# Clinical Features
**Mild**: Dry skin, infrequent itching, small areas of redness
**Moderate**: Dry skin, frequent itching, redness, +/- excoriation
**Severe**: Dry skin, Very frequent itching, redness, excoriation, extensive skin thickening, bleeding, interfere with eating & sleep
# Treatment
- Emollients (1st line)
	- Apply emollients before steroids (E comes before S) as creams soak into skin faster than ointments.
	- Emollients are the 1st line management for flare ups as well.
- Topical steroids
	Apply thinly for short duration. Mostly rely on
	- **Mild strength**: Hydrocortisone acetate 0.5, 1, or 2.5% (Daktacort)
	- **Moderate strength**: Betamethasone valerate (0.025%), Clobetasone (Eumovate)
	- **Potent strength**:
		- Betamethasone valerate (0.1%) (Betnovate),
		- Mometasone (0.1%)-> For severe eczema not responding to emollients and hydrocortisone.
		- Hydrocortisone Butyrate
	- Very potent: Clobetasol propionate (0.5%) aka Dermovate
- #Mnemonic: HEBDO -> Hydrocortisone > Eumovate > Betnovate > Dermovate > Oral
- If eczema awakens the patient at night, consider sedative anti-histamines (Chlorpheniramine)
- Treat bacterial infection with oral antibiotic.

Can use steroid sparing agent like tacrolimus (brand: Protopic). It is a topical calcineurin inhibitor.
