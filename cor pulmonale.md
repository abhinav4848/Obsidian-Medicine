# Cor pulmonale
Cor pulmonale is right ventricular (RV) enlargement and/or failure caused by pulmonary hypertension secondary to disorders of the lungs or pulmonary vasculature, not due to left heart disease.
## Pathophysiology
1. Chronic lung disease → hypoxia → pulmonary vasoconstriction ([[hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction]]).
2. Pulmonary vasoconstriction → increased pulmonary vascular resistance.
3. Right ventricle has to pump against higher resistance → RV hypertrophy.
4. Over time, RV decompensates → right-sided heart failure.
## Causes
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ([[COPD]]) -> Most common cause
- [[interstitial lung disease vs pneumonitis|interstitial lung disease]]
- Pulmonary embolism (chronic)
- Obstructive sleep apnoea
- Pulmonary vascular diseases
## Clinical Features
- Signs of right heart failure: peripheral oedema, raised JVP, hepatomegaly, ascites, systolic parasternal heave, Loud P2
- Fatigue, dyspnoea on exertion
- Loud P2 (pulmonary component of S2)
- Sometimes cyanosis
## Management
- Use loop diuretic for edema, consider [[long term oxygen therapy|LTOT]]. 
- Don't use- ACE-inhibitors, CCB and alpha-blockers.
