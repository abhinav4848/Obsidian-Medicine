| Conversion disorder   | aka ==Functional **neurological** symptom disorder (FNSD)==. <br>Typically involves loss of motor or sensory function (like paralysis, blindness, or seizures) but can't be medically explained. <br><br>The patient doesn't consciously feign the symptoms (factitious disorder) or seek material gain (malingering).<br><br>Patients may be indifferent to their apparent disorder - la belle indifference - although this has not been backed up by some studies |
| Somatisation disorder | Multiple physical SYMPTOMS (like nausea, headache, palpitation) present for at least 2 years. Not intentionally produced. <br><br>Patient refuses to accept reassurance or negative test results<br><br>#mnemonic somatisation-so many symptoms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
