Or
2 abnormal values (> 7) w/o symptoms.

**Normal**: 3.9-5.5 

| Test            | Prediabetic              | Diabetic         |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| FBG             | 6.1 - 6.9 (IFG)          | >=7              |
| 2 hr. with OGTT | 7.8 - 11 (IGT)           | >=11.1           |
| HbA1c           | 42 - 47<br><br>6% - 6.4% | >=48  <br>>=6.5% |

#Mnemonic: 7/11 (Diabetes >=7 fasting, or >11 post prandial) every other day (48 hrs)
% is mmol per mol

# Tests
OGTT is diagnostic for [[diabetes- gestational|diabetes in pregnancy]]. It's not recommended for diagnosing DM.
HbA1c is not suitable for diagnosing DM in children. Do FBS.

Fresh patient with c/f, do FBG (not RBG), cuz it's cheaper than HbA1c.

## IGT
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is defined as fasting plasma glucose less than 7.0 mmol/l and OGTT 2-hour value greater than or equal to 7.8 mmol/l but less than 11.1 mmol/l.
