Most common type is viral & among viruses, most common is HSV-1
# Clinical Features
Seizures/neuro/behavioural changes/psych signs/focal features suggest encephalitis over [[meningitis]].
## *Note:*
- Peripheral lesions (e.g. [[cold sores]]) have no relation to the presence of HSV encephalitis.
- In contrast to other forms of encephalitis (e.g. CMV, cryptococcal), it often affects **immunocompetent** individuals (as well as the immunocompromised).

# Pathophysiology
[[human herpes viruses|HSV-1]] is responsible for 95% of cases in adults
Typically affects temporal and inferior frontal lobes
- Temporal lobe changes: aphasia, hemiparesis, memory loss .
# Investigation
- cerebrospinal fluid
	- lymphocytosis
	- elevated protein
	- PCR for HSV, VZV and enteroviruses
- neuroimaging
	- medial temporal and inferior frontal changes (e.g. petechial haemorrhages)
	- normal in one-third of patients
	- MRI is better -> Prominent swelling and increased signal of the brain
	- CT shows hypodensity in area of cerebral edema -> around Temporal lobe.
- EEG
	- lateralised periodic discharges at 2 Hz

# Treatment
As over 95% of encephalitis cases are caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), IV acyclovir (works against HSV) should be started in all patients urgently.

### Autoimmune encephalitis
is typically the result of a paraneoplastic syndrome (usually secondary to [[cancer- lung|Small cell carcinoma of Lung]] or ovarian teratoma). There should be evidence of malignancy in question for this.

### Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis
is caused by the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans and typically only affects those with severe immunodeficiency (especially AIDS). It has a subacute presentation, with symptoms progressing over several weeks (as opposed to a few days).

### Cytomegalovirus encephalitis
almost always occurs in patients with severe immunodeficiency. In those with [[HIV]], it typically occurs once the CD4 count is <50.
