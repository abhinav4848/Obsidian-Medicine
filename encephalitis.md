# Herpes Encephalitis

## Clinical Features
Seizures/neuro/behavioural changes/psych signs/focal features suggest encephalitis over [meningitis](onenote:#Infectious%20disease&section-id={210C3954-BE8B-A24C-8E7F-F1B991349700}&page-id={AAC77D20-727D-4F7C-BBBE-C0E1BEFF451D}&object-id={8635CB90-061B-42CF-B668-E73B472DAAB9}&14&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/450c0e1b0b9c7922/Documents/Onenote/MBBS/PLAB%201%20+%20MSRA.one).
#### Note:
- Peripheral lesions (e.g. [[cold sores]]) have no relation to the presence of HSV encephalitis.
- In contrast to other forms of encephalitis (e.g. CMV, cryptococcal), it often affects immunocompetent individuals (as well as the immunocompromised).

Pathophysiology

HSV-1 is responsible for 95% of cases in adults

typically affects temporal and inferior frontal lobes

- Temporal lobe changes: aphasia, hemiparesis, memory loss .

Investigation

- cerebrospinal fluid

- lymphocytosis
- elevated protein
- PCR for HSV, VZV and enteroviruses

- neuroimaging

- medial temporal and inferior frontal changes (e.g. petechial haemorrhages)
- normal in one-third of patients
- MRI is better -> Prominent swelling and increased signal of the brain
- CT shows hypodensity in area of cerebral edema -> around Temporal lobe.

- EEG

- lateralised periodic discharges at 2 Hz

# Treatment
As over 95% of encephalitis cases are caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), IV aciclovir (works against HSV) should be started in all patients urgently.

Autoimmune encaphalitis

is typically the result of a paraneoplastic syndrome (usually secondary to small cell lung cancer or ovarian teratoma). There should be evidence of malignancy in question for this.

Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis

is caused by the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans and typically only affects those with severe immunodeficiency (especially AIDS). It has a subacute presentation, with symptoms progressing over several weeks (as opposed to a few days).

Cytomegalovirus encephalitis

almost always occurs in patients with severe immunodeficiency. In those with HIV, it typically occurs once the CD4 count is <50.
