Patients with liver cirrhosis are at risk of developing portal hypertension which leads to varices and [[_upper gi bleed|UGIB]]. 

Q: A 54-year-old man with a history of alcohol-related [[cirrhosis]] is reviewed in your GP surgery following an outpatient endoscopy, which revealed medium-sized oesophageal varices. He has had no previous gastrointestinal bleeding and is asymptomatic. His liver function tests are stable and he has no contraindications to beta-blockers. 
> A non-cardioselective B-blocker (NSBB) is used for the primary prophylaxis of oesophageal bleeding.

NSBBs reduce portal hypertension by 
1. Decreasing cardiac output and 
2. Inducing splanchnic vasoconstriction, 
thereby lowering the risk of initial haemorrhage. Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker plus mild Î±1-adrenergic antagonist. It is more effective at lowering hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) than propranolol and is recommended as the agent of choice in compensated cirrhosis.

- Sclerotherapy has been superseded by band ligation. 
- Band ligation is an alternative to NSBBs however medical management is first line unless contraindications/intolerance/declines. 
- TIPSS (Trans-jugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) is reserved for refractory cases where both medical therapy and endoscopic management have failed or in secondary prophylaxis after recurrent bleeds.
