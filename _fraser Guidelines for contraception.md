The Fraser guidelines are used to assess if patient who has not yet reached 16 years of age is competent to consent to treatment, for example with respect to contraception  
  
The following points should be fulfilled:  

- the young person understands the professional's advice
- the young person cannot be persuaded to inform their parents or allow the professional to contact them on their behalf
	- every effort should be made by the medical professional to encourage the minor to involve their parents or guardians. However, if this isn't possible, then contraception can still be provided.
- the young person is likely to begin, or continue having, sexual intercourse with or without contraceptive treatment
- unless the young person receives contraceptive treatment, their physical or mental health, or both, is likely to suffer
- the young person's best interests require them to receive contraceptive advice or treatment with or without parental consent
