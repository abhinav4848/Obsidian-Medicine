2 types broadly. 
# Small cell carcinoma (15%) 
Usually not amenable to resection (chemo and radio done & have good response) 
#mnemonic *Small cells are so small that surgeons can't see them.* 
### Paraneoplastic effects
- Releases ADH -> [[SIADH]] -> Dilutional hyponatremia, Hypokalemia 
- ACTH -> [[cushing's syndrome]] 
- **Lambert-Eaton**: Antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels. Same as Myasthenia gravis, but: #confusion Reflexes are absent and elicited after exercise. Increased strength/power of weakened muscle after repeated test. 
- autoimmune [[encephalitis]].

# Non-Small cell carcinoma (85%)
Usually amenable to surgery. 
### Subtypes 
1. Adenocarcinoma (50%) -> More common in non-smokers. 
2. Squamous cell carcinoma (30%) -> More common in smokers. Large polygonal cell with keratin pearl & bridges. 
3. large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (5%) 
4. carcinoid tumour (5%) 

### Paraneoplastic syndrome from Squamous cell carcinoma 
SqCC bronchus -> Releases PTH-like molecules (but actual PTH will be low) -> [[Hypercalcemia]]. 

More common than paraneoplastic SIADH. 
- Serum PTH will be low (1* & 3* [[hyperparathyroidism]] ruled out). 
- Then check [[biochemical differences in different ortho conditions#High ALP causes|ALP]] -> high ALP (+ high Ca) means [[cancers metastasizing to the bone|bone metastasis]]. 

Clubbing, Hyperthyroidism, due to ectopic TSH.

# Investigation 
CXR- first line for suspected lung cancer. 
	10% of patients subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer had normal CXR. 
CT- IoC for suspected lung cancer. 
Bronchoscopy- to take biopsy.
