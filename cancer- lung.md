# Types
## Small cell carcinoma (15%)
usually not amenable to resection (chemo and radio done) 
#mnemonic *Small cells are so small that surgeons can't see them.* 
### Paraneoplastic effects
- Releases ADH -> [[SIADH]] -> Dilutional hyponatremia, Hypokalemia
- ACTH -> Cushing
- **Lambert-Eaton**: Antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels. Same as Myasthenia gravis, but: Reflexes are absent and elicited after exercise. Increased strength/power of weakened muscle after repeated test.

## Non-Small cell carcinoma (85%)
Usually amenable to surgery. 
### Subtypes
1. Adenocarcinoma (50%) -> More common in non-smokers. 
2. Squamous cell carcinoma (30%)-> More common in smokers. Large polygonal cell with keratin pearl & bridges. 
3. large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (5%)
4. carcinoid tumour (5%)

#### Paraneoplastic syndrome from Squamous cell carcinoma
SCC bronchus -> Releases PTH-like molecules (but actual PTH will be low) -> [[Hypercalcemia]]. 
More common than SIADH.
- Serum PTH will be low (1* & 3* Hyperparathyroidism ruled out)
- Then check ALP -> high ALP (+ high Ca) means bone metastasis.
