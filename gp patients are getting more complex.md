Everything that was core GP work has become outsourced in the name of “efficiency”.
- MSK issue -> First contact physio
- Chronic disease -> Community Heart failure/Diabetes/Asthma clinic
- Any practical procedure -> Hidden behind paywall instead of being core portion of GP training
- Easy wins (sinusitis, OE, OM, LRTIs) -> To ACPs/Pharmacy 1st

It’s largely relegated GPs to 10min medicine for the most complex cases. It’s created a generation of GPs who have grown resentful just from trying to keep their head above the water in a room rapidly filling with water. Most of my colleagues in the NHS have dropped their NHS work to 4 sessions (2 days) because that’s often all they can hack.
