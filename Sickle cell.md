# Sickle Cell
Admit all people with clinical features of a sickle cell crisis to hospital unless they are:
- A well adult who only has mild or moderate pain and has a temperature of 38Â°C or less.
- A well child who only has mild or moderate pain and does not have an increased temperature.

This is because of increased infection risk due to **Hyposplenism**.
## Crises
A number of types of crises are recognized:

| Clinical Presentation                          | Causes                                                                                                                                                | Key Features                                                                                                                                                               |

| Thrombotic, 'Vaso-occlusive', 'Painful Crises' | - Infection<br>- Dehydration<br>- Deoxygenation (e.g., high altitude)                                                                                 | - Infarcts occur in various organs including bones (e.g., avascular necrosis of hip, hand-foot syndrome in children), lungs, spleen, and brain                             |
| Acute Chest Syndrome                           | Vaso-occlusion within the pulmonary microvasculature                                                                                                  | - Dyspnoea - Chest pain - Pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray - Low pO2<br>- transfusion: improves oxygenation<br><br>- Most common cause of death after childhood        |
| Anemic                                         | Aplastic: [[Erythema infectiosum\|Parvovirus B19]]<br><br>Sequestration: sickling within organs such as the spleen or lungs                           | - Aplastic anemia: Reduced Retic count. Sudden drop in Hb.<br><br>- Sequestration: Pooling of blood with worsening anemia, associated with an increased reticulocyte count |
| Infection                                      | Sickle cell patients are predisposed to spondylodiscitis secondary to [[Typhoid\|salmonella]] infection and the back pain + fever would be suggestive |                                                                                                                                                                            |
# Treatment
Analgesia, fluids, oxygen, abx if infection suspected
#### Blood Transfusion
- Indications: Severe/Symptomatic anemia, pregnancy, pre-op
- does not rapidly reduce the percentage of Hb S containing cells
#### Exchange Transfusion
- Indications: Acute vaso-occlusive crisis (stroke, acute chest syndrome, multiorgan failure, splenic sequestration crisis
- rapidly reduces the percentage of Hb S containing cells
