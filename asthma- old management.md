MART is recommended (use [[asthma- new management 2024]])
# Adult stable asthma management
1. **Reliever**: SABA (if < 3 attacks- excessive use of SABA to relieve acute asthma symptoms may mask progression of the underlying disease and contribute to an increased risk of severe and potentially life-threatening asthma exacerbations. So [always give with ICS](https://www.sign.ac.uk/our-guidelines/british-guideline-on-the-management-of-asthma/). )
2. Add regular preventer: SABA + Low dose ICS (beclomethasone)
3. SABA + low ICS + LTRA
4. SABA + low ICS + LABA +/- LTRA
5. SABA + low MART* (ICS+LABA) +/- LTRA
6. SABA + med MART (ICS+LABA) +/- LTRA
7. SABA +/- LTRA +
	1. Increase to high dose ICS (not as MART. Done by specialist), or
	2. trial of LAMA, theophylline
	3. Seek expert opinion

* MART: Maintenance & Reliever therapy (has fast acting LABA- Formoterol)

# Child stable asthma management %%linked%%
**5-16yo**: In Step 4, if LTRA hasn't helped, NICE says to stop it in children. 
**<5yo**: If child < 5yo, don’t give LABA ([NICE CKS under 5 Asthma management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-children-under-5), [Leicester guidance](https://www.lmsg.nhs.uk/guidelines/category/respiratory/))

1. **Newly-diagnosed asthma**- Short-acting beta agonist (SABA)
2. **Not controlled on previous step** OR **Newly-diagnosed asthma with symptoms >= 3/week**, OR **night-time waking** 
	1. SABA + an 8-week trial of paediatric MODERATE-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)
	2. After 8-weeks stop the ICS and monitor the child's symptoms:
		- if symptoms did not resolve during the trial period, review whether an alternative diagnosis is likely
		- if symptoms resolved, then reoccurred within **4 weeks** of stopping ICS treatment, restart the ICS at a paediatric low dose as first-line maintenance therapy
		- if symptoms resolved but reoccurred beyond 4 weeks after stopping ICS treatment, repeat the 8‑week trial of a paediatric moderate dose of ICS
3. SABA + paediatric low-dose ICS + leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA)
4. Stop the LTRA and refer to a paediatric asthma specialist
