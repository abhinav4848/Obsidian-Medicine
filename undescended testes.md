Occurs in aroundÂ 2-3% of term male infants, but is much more common if the baby is preterm. Around 25% of cases are bilateral.

*From the [[_newborn Infant physical examination|NIPE]] guide.* 
## Complications of undescended testis 
- infertility
- torsion
- testicular cancer (seminoma, germ cell tumor)
- psychological

## Management 
### Unilateral undescended testis
- May be monitored in Primary care. Review at infant screening, if still not descended, then again at 4-5 months age. If inguinal testes felt between inguinal canal and scrotum, it may be gently manipulated into the scrotum. 
- Referral should be considered from around 3 months of age, with the baby ideally seeing a urological surgeon not later than 6 months of age
- **Orchidopexy**: Surgical practices vary although the majority of procedures are performed at around 1 year of age. 

### Bilateral undescended testes
May be associated with underlying endocrine disorders (such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]) and ambiguous genitalia and therefore early pediatric input is necessary. 

- Should be reviewed by a senior pediatrician within 24 hours as the child may need urgent endocrine or genetic investigation. 

# Extra Reading
Testes that are palpable at both screening examinations may ascend later in childhood, so any concerns expressed by parents should be addressed.
