**Migrans**: migrating redness
# Clinical Features
Lyme disease
- flu-like symptoms: headache, lethargy, fever, arthralgia
- late features: heart block, peri/myocarditis, facial nerve palsy, meningitis

**Target lesion**
- annular rash with scaly edges develops 3-30 days after h/o camping, walking in jungles.
- Lesion is due to an actual infection at the site. This is a single rash that expands. 
- present in around 80% of patients.

Other rashes in Lyme
- Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (this is due to _B. afzelii_)
- Borrelia lymphocytosis
# Investigation
ELISA for Borrelia antibodies is first line test, but if rash present, treat straightaway. 
- if negative ELISA but Lyme still suspected in people who were tested within 4 weeks of symptoms, repeat ELISA 4-6 weeks after first test. 
- If still suspected in people who have had symptoms for >=12 weeks, immunoblot test should be done. 
- If any test is positive or equivocal, then an immunoblot test for lyme should be done. 
# Treatment
Oral Doxycycline for 3 weeks. (but if pregnant -> Amoxicillin)
- Disseminated disease: Ceftriaxone
- People with erythema migrans should be commenced on antibiotic without the need for further tests

>[!notice]
>Doxycycline is 1st line in Lyme & [[chlamydia|Chlamydia]] [[gynaecological infections#Cervicitis|cervicitis]].
>Ceftriaxone is also in Meningococcal [[meningitis]], [[gonorrhoea]].

Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction #named is sometimes seen after initiating therapy: fever, rash, tachycardia after first dose of antibiotic (more commonly seen in syphilis, another spirochaetal disease)

## Asymptomatic tick bites
- No need for prophylactic abx for Lyme disease in asymptomatic patients bitten by tick. 
- If the tick is still present, the best way to remove it is using fine-tipped tweezers, grasping the tick as close to the skin as possible and pulling upwards firmly. The area should be washed following.
- NICE guidance does not recommend routine antibiotic treatment to patients who've suffered a tick bite
