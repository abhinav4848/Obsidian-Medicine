Monocular painless visual loss. (also seen in [[optic neuritis]])

May be associated with [[giant cell arteritis]].

Curtain falling down on vision (similar to [[retinal detachment]] but is transient).

Since thrombus originates most likely from carotid artery, do carotid doppler & [[_tia|endarterectomy]].
