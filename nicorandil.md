Nicorandil, a potassium channel activator with nitrate-like properties, does not typically result in tolerance. It has dual mechanism of action:
- Nitrate moiety: causing venous and arterial vasodilation
- Potassium channel activation: provides effective angina relief without the risk of developing tolerance.

Avoid taking [[sildenafil]] for ED if taking Nicorandil or Nitrates.

Sildenafil works by releasing Nitric oxide. Nicorandil has a nitrate component already -> Their combined effect can cause drop in BP.
