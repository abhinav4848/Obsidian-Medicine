# Examination of a child
https://geekymedics.com/category/osce/clinical-examination/paediatrics/
if the child has scratches or lumps or nose bleed and parents don't know how that happened, ask if there are siblings or are they alone at home or not, any other children at home the child may have been rough housing. 


Do the three ‘quiet things’ first: 
- auscultation of heart sounds, 
- auscultation of breath sounds and 
- palpation of femoral pulses.

Examine the whole body. Include the oral (note moist mucosa), ear exam (use tongue depressor for back of throat), use otoscope to look into the ear and nostril if needed. 
- Difficulty with breastfeeding or inadequate oral fluid intake (50–75% of usual volume).
- Note the degree of agitation and consciousness. 
	- Agitation and behavioural changes in a child may be a sign of hypoxia. 
- Look for signs of exhaustion, cyanosis (bluish lips or extremities), and involvement of accessory muscles of respiration while the child is at rest.
- Examine the child's chest, and record their respiratory rate, pulse, and blood pressure. [[vitals in children]]
- Measure the child's oxygen saturation in room air using pulse oximetry (if available).
	- Persistent oxygen saturation of less than 92% when breathing air.
- Hydration status by measuring capillary refill time, examining skin turgor and dryness of mucous membranes, and ascertaining urine output.
	- Clinical dehydration (indicated by reduced skin turgor and/or a capillary refill time of more than three seconds, and/or dry mucous membranes, and/or reduced urine output).
	- Put pressure for 5 seconds

Advice
- **If the child does not require hospital admission:**
    - Advise the parents/carers that bronchiolitis is usually a self-limiting illness and that symptoms tend to peak between three and five days of onset.
    - Provide self-care advice:
        - Advise the parents/carers to use either paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat a child who is distressed due to fever. Antipyretic medications should not be used with the sole aim of reducing body temperature and should be continued for only as long as the child appears distressed.
        - Advise the parents/carers to consider changing to the other medication if the child's distress is not alleviated, but not to give both medications simultaneously, and to only alternate the medication if the distress persists, or recurs before the next dose is due.
        - Advise them not attempt to reduce fever by under-dressing the child or with use of tepid sponging.
        - Advise them to encourage the child to take fluids regularly. For infants that are breastfed, advise continued breastfeeding.
        - Avoid aspirin in children under 16yo. 
    - Advise parents/ carers to check on the child regularly, including through the night, and to seek medical advice if they are unable to cope, or if the child deteriorates, particularly if:
        - Breathing rate increases or there are any episodes of apnoea, signs of cyanosis, or increased effort of breathing (such as grunting, nasal flaring, or marked chest recession).
        - The child's fluid intake is reduced to 50–75% of normal, or there are signs of dehydration such as dry mouth or no wet nappy for 12 hours.
        - The child becomes less responsive or difficult to rouse.
        - There is persistent worsening of fever.
    - Advise the child's parents/carers not smoke in the home as this increases the risk of more severe symptoms of bronchiolitis
    - Use clinical judgement to determine whether follow-up is necessary, and if so, arrange at an appropriate interval.
