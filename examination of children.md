- Most infants start teething around 6 months of age
	- 1% before 4 months & 
	- 1% after 12 months. 
- A full set of deciduous teeth has usually emerged by 2–3 years of age.
- By about 6 years of age, these deciduous teeth start to fall out, to be replaced with permanent teeth. 

See: [[paeds examination.canvas]]
# Red book
[NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/baby/babys-development/height-weight-and-reviews/baby-reviews/): It's personal child health record (PCHR). 
Ask if red book is up to date. Good idea to bring it with baby to the clinic. 
Records child's height & weight, vaccinations. Patient can record illness/accidents/medicines baby has had. 
Also record developmental milestones. 
See if [[guthrie test|Heel prick test]] showed anything. 
Any documentation from [[newborn Infant physical examination|NIPE]]. 
### premature babies
If your baby was born prematurely, their developmental age will be calculated from your original due date, not from the actual date they were born, until they are 2 years old.
