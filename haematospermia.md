**Information and Guidance for Primary Care**
# Introduction
- Haematospermia is the visible presence of blood in the semen.
- The blood appears red when bleeding is recent and red/brown when old.
- It is usually temporary and almost always benign.
# Association with Malignancy
There is no clear link between haematospermia and [[cancer- prostate|Prostate Cancer]] in men with:
- A normal digital rectal examination (DRE)
- A normal [[prostate|PSA test]]
# Common Causes
### Inflammatory conditions (including STIs)
- Vesiculitis
- Prostatitis
- Urethritis
- Epididymitis
### Other
- Seminal vesicle cysts
# Primary Care Assessment
On presentation of a man with haematospermia:
- Examine scrotum for abnormal masses
- Check blood pressure (to exclude malignant hypertension)
- Perform urinalysis 
- Screen and treat for STI (or signpost to local GU pathway)
- If >40 years, examine prostate (DRE) for malignancy and check PSA
## Management
- If examination and investigations are normal:
    - Reassure and discharge
    - This applies irrespective of age and number of episodes
    - No requirement for routine referral to secondary care
- If unsure, consider using your local advice and guidance pathway
## Imaging
- Contrary to previous guidance, there is no clear evidence that haematospermia increases malignancy risk in men over 40, including prostate cancer, when PSA and DRE are normal.
- Multiparametric MRI is not recommended in men with normal PSA and DRE.
