# Special Cases
all babies, including those born prematurely, should receive their first set of vaccinations at 8 weeks from birth. This is because premature babies are at higher risk of infections and therefore need protection provided by vaccines as soon as possible. The timing of vaccination is based on chronological age, not corrected gestational age.
