# Side Effects of SSRIs 
For all antidepressants, warn about: 
- delay in onset of effect
- transient increase in anxiety/depression, 
	- Risk of suicide and likelihood of toxicity in overdose (especially with venlafaxine)
- risk of withdrawal if stopped abruptly. Happens in 50% of patients and is linked to increased doses and durations. 
	- especially with paroxetine (SSRI) and venlafaxine (SNRI) 
	- Taper gradually over an extended period of time. ([GP notebook](https://gpnotebook.com/en-GB/pages/gastroenterology/antidepressants-stopping-or-switching-treatment))
	- Withdrawal symptoms: Dizziness, numbness and tingling, GI disturbances (nausea & vomiting), headache, sweating, anxiety, sleep disturbances
- Risk of GI bleed with SSRIs. So avoid them if Warfarin used. 
	- If NSAID, Aspirin used, add PPI too. ([BNF Interactions](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/interactions/sertraline/))
- Avoid Triptans & MAOi as [[fever caused by drugs|Serotonin syndrome]]. 
- All SSRIs lower [[seizure]] threshold and cause [[hyponatremia]]. 
- Be aware when prescribing SSRIs of the need to ask about cocaine use when considering drug–drug interactions, and the need to avoid concurrent use of multiple serotonergic drugs. 
- SSRIs can cause sexual dysfunction, genital numbness, anorgasmia (esp Mirtazapine)
