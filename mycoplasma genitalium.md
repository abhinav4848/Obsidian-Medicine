This bug has quietly gone from trivia to exam + real-world headache.

Out of 16 species of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma infecting humans, five are established pathogens, rest are normal flora of oral and urogenital tract. The human pathogenic Mycoplasma species are:
- pneumoniae causing [[pneumonia]]
- hominis & genitalium: genital tract infections

## 🦠 Mycoplasma genitalium — why everyone suddenly cares
### Big picture
Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) is a sexually transmitted bacterium that:
- Causes persistent genital tract inflammation
- Is hard to detect
- Is hard to treat
- Is increasingly antibiotic-resistant

That combo is why it’s now a big deal in PID discussions.

---
## 1️⃣ What kind of organism is it?
- Very small bacterium
- No cell wall ❗  
    → Beta-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins) do nothing
- Slow-growing → can’t be cultured routinely
- Detected only by NAAT (PCR)

📌 This already makes it sneaky.

---
## 2️⃣ What does it cause?
### In women
- Cervicitis
- Endometritis
- Salpingitis
- PID
- Possibly infertility (evidence growing)
### In men
- Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU)
- Persistent urethral symptoms despite treatment

📌 Key clue: ongoing symptoms with negative chlamydia/gonorrhoea tests.

---
## 3️⃣ Why it matters specifically in PID

### 🔴 It causes _real_ PID
Not just association — causative:
- Found in upper genital tract tissue
- Linked to tubal inflammation
- Present in chlamydia-negative PID

But:
- Often missed
- Not covered well by standard PID regimens

---
## 4️⃣ Why standard antibiotics fail
### ❌ Doxycycline
- Only ~30% effective
- Reduces bacterial load but doesn’t clear infection
### ❌ Macrolides (azithromycin)
- High resistance rates (30–70% in some regions)
- Single-dose azithro is especially bad (selects resistance)

### ✅ Fluoroquinolones
- Moxifloxacin works best
- But resistance is now emerging here too 😬

📌 This is why guidelines are tightening up.

---
## 5️⃣ Why it’s “increasingly important” (the real reasons)
### 🧨 1. Antibiotic resistance
- Rapid global rise in macrolide resistance
- Few remaining effective oral options

### 🧨 2. Persistent / recurrent PID
- Patients treated “appropriately”
- Symptoms don’t resolve
- Swabs negative for CT/GC  
    → M. genitalium often the culprit

### 🧨 3. Testing lagged behind reality
- NAATs only became widely available recently
- Many older studies of PID never tested for it
- We’re now realising how common it is

---
## 6️⃣ Who should be tested for M. genitalium?
(Not everyone — important!)
### ✅ Test if:
- Persistent cervicitis
- Recurrent or treatment-resistant PID
- Ongoing symptoms after CT/GC treatment
- Sexual health clinic setting
### ❌ Not for:
- Asymptomatic screening
- Routine discharge without risk factors

📌 Over-testing → more resistance → worse outcomes.

---
## 7️⃣ How this changes PID thinking
Old model:
> Chlamydia + gonorrhoea ± anaerobes

New model:
> Chlamydia + gonorrhoea + anaerobes + M. genitalium

Which explains:
- Swab-negative PID
- Poor response to doxycycline
- Recurrent symptoms

---
## 8️⃣ Exam-ready one-liner
> _Mycoplasma genitalium_ is an emerging sexually transmitted cause of cervicitis and PID that lacks a cell wall, is difficult to detect, and shows high levels of macrolide resistance, making persistent or treatment-resistant PID more common.
