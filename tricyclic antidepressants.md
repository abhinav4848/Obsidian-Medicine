Antagonism of [[anticholinergics|muscarinic receptors]]. 
Antagonism of adrenergic receptors

[[qt prolongation|Lengthening of QT interval]]

# Management 
- IV bicarbonate may reduce the risk of seizures and arrhythmias in severe toxicity
- Arrhythmias: 
	- Class 1a (e.g. Quinidine) and class 1c antiarrhythmics (e.g. Flecainide) are contraindicated as they prolong depolarisation. 
	- Class III drugs such as amiodarone should also be avoided as they prolong the QT interval. 
	- Response to lignocaine is variable and it should be emphasized that correction of acidosis is the first line in management of tricyclic induced arrhythmias
- Dialysis is ineffective in removing tricyclics
