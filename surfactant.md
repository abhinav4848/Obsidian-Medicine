**Surfactants** reduce surface tension → help things spread, wet, emulsify, or disrupt membranes.

They're classified by the charge on the head of the molecule in water.

Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.
# Anionic surfactants
- Negatively charged head group
- Great cleaners
- Tend to be more irritating to skin/mucosa- that's why dermatology prefers soap substitutes
- Inactivated by organic matter and by cationic surfactants

e.g. 
1. Sodium Lauryl sulphate (SLS)- can worsen eczema, irritant dermatitis
2. Soaps (fatty acid salts- Sodium stearate)- causes drying, disrupts skin barrier. 
3. Bile Salts (physiological)- helps emulsify fats in gut
# Cationic surfactants
- Positively charged head group
- Bind to negatively charged bacterial cell membranes
- Antimicrobial
- Less foaming, not great cleaners, but good antiseptics
- Can be toxic if absorbed/systemic

e.g. 
1. Chlorhexidine- good antiseptic, mouthwash, catheter care by disrupting bacterial membrane
2. Cetylpyridinium chloride- mouthwash, throat lozenges
3. Benzalkonium chloride (BAC)- used in eye drops, nasal sprays, surface disinfectants. Can damage corneal epithelium with chronic use.
	1. For long term management of [[plaque psoriasis|scalp psoriasis]], some patients are not keen on the smell of tar based preparations and may wish to try an alternative such as Dermax ® shampoo
	2. [BNF](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/benzalkonium-chloride/)
4. Cetrimide- Antiseptic cream, wound care
