- Primary dysmenorrhea: starts before or within a few hours of starting periods. 
- Secondary dysmenorrhea: starts 3-4 days before period. Refer all secondary dysmenorrhea to gynae.
# Treatment
**1st line**: Mefenamic acid (also used in [[Menorrhagia]])/Ibuprofen.
**2nd line**: COCP if mefenamic acid ineffective.
- One of the non-contraceptive benefits of COCs is that they can reduce menstrual pain (dysmenorrhoea). They do this by suppressing ovulation and reducing menstrual flow, which can alleviate painful cramps. 
IUS may help dysmenorrhea.
