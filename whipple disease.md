# Investigation
Jejunal biopsy shows Stunted Villi and deposition of macrophages containing Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) granules. Diagnostic #important 
  
# Management
Oral co-trimoxazole #abx for a year is thought to have the lowest relapse rate, sometimes preceded by a course of IV penicillin

The most important point is than a patient with indigestion and Jejunal biopsy reveals Macrophages with PAS Granules -> Whipple's disease.
