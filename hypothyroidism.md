**UK**: Autoimmune: Hashimoto [[thyroiditis]]. 
	Hashimoto acute phase is hyperthyroid (later becomes hypo)
**World**: Nutritional: Iodine deficiency

**Drugs**: Lithium, Amiodarone, Carbimazole, Rifampicin

# Clinical Features
Goitre in both cases.
Amenorrhea/Oligomenorrhea
Cold peripheries, coarse hair/hair loss, dry/thick coarse skin, brittle nails, bradycardia, weight gain.
Weight gain, myxedema (e.g. change in shoe size)
Macrocytosis, Proximal myopathy

## Associated conditions
- Autoimmune disease
	- Vitiligo, ADDISON'S disease, Pernicious Anaemia, DM type 1.
- Hyperprolactinemia
- [[Pseudogout]]. 
	- Knee > wrist ankle, shoulder
	- Positive birefringent crystals

# Treatment
If a patient has Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TSH high, T4 normal)
	Repeat TSH in 3 months.

If TSH raised but below 10miU/L (on 2 tests 3 months apart)
- Asymptomatic: No Rx needed.
- >=65yo: No Rx needed. (risk of over-suppression of TSH causing A fib)
- Symptomatic + <65yo: Levothyroxine

If need to start,
- The therapeutic goal is TSH normalisation.
- Cardiac disease/severe hypothyroid/age > 50: start with 25mcg OD
- Others: start with 50-100 mcg.
- women with established hypothyroidism who become pregnant should have their dose increased 'by at least 25-50 micrograms levothyroxine'* due to the increased demands of pregnancy.
If the TSH is still high and T3 and/or T4 is still low
	Increase the dose of the Levothyroxine.

## s/e of Thyroxine therapy
- Hyperthyroidism (overtreatment)
- Reduced bone mineral density
- Worsening of angina (so start low dose in patient with CVD)
- A fib.

# NOTE
Never give Ferrous sulphate + Levothyroxine at the same time!

#mnemonic: RICO -> Rifampicin, Iron supplement, Calcium, Omeprazole interferes with Levothyroxine's absorption and thus reduces its effectiveness. Therefore, they should be given at separate times with long intervals.
