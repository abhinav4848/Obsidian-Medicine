# Causes of Exacerbation
## Aetiology
-  [[spirometry#COPD|Mod or Severe COPD]] 
- > 65 years of age or patients with significant comorbidities
-  Viral infections or other factors like environmental irritants or poor adherence to medication.
## Infective Exacerbation
The most common infective causes of COPD exacerbations are:  
- bacteria
    - _[[haemophilus influenzae]]_ (most common cause)
    - _Streptococcus pneumoniae_
    - _Moraxella catarrhalis_
- respiratory viruses
    - account for around 30% of exacerbations
    - human rhinovirus is the most important pathogen
# Clinical Features
- dyspnea, cough, wheeze
- increase in sputum suggesting infection
- Patients can be hypoxic, some may have acute confusion

# Management
## Oxygen
24% - 28% Oxygen (not 100%) using "venturi face mask"
Maintain O2 saturation between 88-92% if retaining.

## Salbutamol
Nebulized [[asthma- drugs|salbutamol]] (with ipratropium bromide).

## Steroids
Prednisolone 30 mg stat. (or 100 mg IV hydrocortisone)
	Prednisolone should be continued as 30 mg OD for 5 days. 
## Antibiotics
If purulent sputum, fever, high CRP, signs of Pneumonia -> give Antibiotics (see Nice [NG114](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng114)).
- While those with Mod or Severe COPD have a higher risk of exacerbation, only give abx is symptom of infection as exacerbation can happen without infection. 

Still no response? -> IV aminophylline.

## NIV/BiPAP
After giving above medical management, if he is still dyspnoeic, with respiratory acidosis: Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) -> BiPAP.

If NIV fails or is C/I (Respiratory arrest, high aspiration risk, impaired mental status): Invasive ventilation
	E.g: pH < 7.26, pCO2 still rising despite NIV
