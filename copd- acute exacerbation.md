# Causes of Exacerbation
## Aetiology
-  [[spirometry#COPD|Mod or Severe COPD]] 
- > 65 years of age or patients with significant comorbidities
-  Viral infections or other factors like environmental irritants or poor adherence to medication.
## Infective Exacerbation
The most common infective causes of COPD exacerbations are:  
- bacteria
    - _[[haemophilus influenzae]]_ (most common cause)
    - _Streptococcus pneumoniae_
    - _Moraxella catarrhalis_
- respiratory viruses
    - account for around 30% of exacerbations
    - human rhinovirus is the most important pathogen
# Clinical Features
- dyspnea, cough, wheeze
- increase in sputum suggesting infection
- Patients can be hypoxic, some may have acute confusion

# Primary Care Management
## Salbutamol
Nebulized [[asthma- drugs|salbutamol]] (with ipratropium bromide).
## Steroids
Prednisolone 30 mg stat. (or 100 mg IV hydrocortisone)
	Prednisolone should be continued as 30 mg OD for 5 days. 
## Antibiotics
If purulent sputum, fever, high CRP, signs of [[Pneumonia]] -> give Antibiotics (see Nice [NG114](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng114)).
- Choose between: amoxicillin / clarithromycin / doxycycline. #abx
- Even though it's common practice to give abx in exacerbation, NICE does not support it. 
- While those with Mod or Severe COPD have a higher risk of exacerbation, only give abx if there is symptom of infection. Exacerbation can happen without infection.

# Hospital Admission
Admit if: 
- severe breathlessness
- acute confusion or impaired consciousness
- cyanosis
- oxygen saturation less than 90% on pulse oximetry. 
- social reasons e.g. inability to cope at home (or living alone)
- significant comorbidity (such as cardiac disease or insulin-dependent diabetes)

## Oxygen therapy
Before ABG:
- COPD patients are at risk of hypercapnia (CO2 Narcosis- depressed consciousness)
- Aim initial sats 88-92% if no ABG. 
- 24% - 28% Oxygen (not 100%) using "venturi face mask"
After ABG: 
- Adjust target range to 94 - 98% if the pCO2 is normal

## Nebulised Bronchodilator
- SABA (Salbutamol)
- SAMA (Ipratropium)

## Steroid
Prednisolone 30 mg Prednisolone stat. (or 100 mg IV hydrocortisone)

## IV Theophylline
May be considered if no response to Nebulised Bronchodilators

## NIV/BiPAP
After giving above medical management, if he is still dyspnoeic, with respiratory acidosis ([[respiratory failure|type 2 resp failure]]): Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) -> BiPAP.

If NIV fails or is C/I (Respiratory arrest, high aspiration risk, impaired mental status): Invasive ventilation
	E.g: pH < 7.26, pCO2 still rising despite NIV
