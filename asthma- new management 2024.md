# For a new diagnosis of Asthma in patients aged >= 12 years

## Step 1 
[NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=and%20over.-,Initial%20management%20of%20newly%20diagnosed%20asthma%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-1.7.1 "NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)") 
- a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken as needed for symptom relief
    - this is termed anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy
- if the patient presents highly symptomatic (for example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation:
    - start treatment with low-dose MART (see step 2)
    - treat the acute symptoms as appropriate (e.g. a course of oral corticosteroids may be indicated)
  
## Step 2
[NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=asthma%20management.-,Medicine%20combination%20and%20sequencing%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-For%20guidance%20on "NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)") 
- a low-dose MART
    - MART describes using ICS/formoterol combination inhaler for daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as needed, i.e. regularly and
  
## Step 3
- a moderate-dose MART

## Step 4 
[NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=Check%20the%20fractional%20exhaled%20nitric%20oxide%20\(FeNO\)%20level%20if%20available "NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)") 
- If Asthma not controlled despite med MART, check for type 2 inflammation with FeNO & blood eosinophil count 
    - if either is raised, refer to a specialist in asthma care
    - if neither is raised, add on LTRA/LAMA to mod MART
    - if control has not improved, stop the LTRA or LAMA and start a trial of the alternative medicine (LTRA or LAMA)

## Step 5
- refer people to a specialist in asthma care when asthma is not controlled despite treatment with moderate-dose MART, and trials of an LTRA and a LAMA
