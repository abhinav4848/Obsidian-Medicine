# For a new diagnosis of Asthma in patients aged >= 12 years

## Step 1 
[NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=and%20over.-,Initial%20management%20of%20newly%20diagnosed%20asthma%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-1.7.1 "NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)") 
- a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken **as needed** (prn) for symptom relief
    - this is termed anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy #mnemonic AIR-prn
- if the patient presents highly symptomatic (for example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation:
    - start treatment with low-dose MART- Maintenance & Reliever therapy (see step 2)
    - treat the acute symptoms as appropriate (e.g. a course of oral corticosteroids may be indicated)
## Step 2
[NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=asthma%20management.-,Medicine%20combination%20and%20sequencing%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-For%20guidance%20on "NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)") 
- a low-dose MART for daily maintenance + PRN 
## Step 3
- a moderate-dose MART
## Step 4 
[NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=Check%20the%20fractional%20exhaled%20nitric%20oxide%20\(FeNO\)%20level%20if%20available "NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)") 
- If Asthma not controlled despite med MART, check for type 2 inflammation with FeNO & blood eosinophil count 
    - if either is raised, refer to a specialist in asthma care
    - if neither is raised, add on LTRA/LAMA to mod MART
	    - if control has not improved, stop the LTRA or LAMA and start a trial of the alternative medicine (LTRA or LAMA)
## Step 5
- If still not controlled after moderate-dose MART + trials of an LTRA and a LAMA ->refer people to a specialist in asthma care.

# Asthma Management 5-11yo
**Step 1**: Start with Paediatric low dose ICS + SABA inhaler

If need to step up to MART, assess if able to use device & okay with use of unlicensed product for those <6yo ([[asthma- drugs#Drugs Licensed for Asthma]])

✅if yes for MART:

**Step 2**: Switch to paediatric low-dose MART
- ICS-Formoterol 100/6 + PRN of the same inhaler
- *low dose: Budesonide 100-200mcg/day*

**Step 3**: Increase to paediatric moderate-dose MART
- ICS-Formoterol 100/6 + PRN of the same inhaler
- *moderate dose: Budesonide 300-400mcg/day*

❌if not, use [[asthma- old management#Child stable asthma management]]
