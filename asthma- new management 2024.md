# New diagnosis of Asthma in patients aged >=12yo
AIR & MART contain the same ICS/Formoterol combo. So the name is only to emphasize the use case of the inhaler. Only to relive vs Relieve + Maintain. The key innovation isn’t the drugs, it’s the strategy.

- Trial 8-12 weeks SABA + BD Paeds low dose  ICS 
	- This is if it looks like they'll need maintenance therapy (h/o atopy), severe acute episodes of DiB/wheeze shown by hospital admission or needing >=2 courses of Oral Steroids. 
- If symptoms don't resolve during trial period, check triggers/technique/adherence/other diagnosis likely. If still no, refer to specialist. 
- Stop ICS and SABA after 8–12 weeks if symptoms resolve, with a 3-month follow-up review.
	- If symptoms recur or a severe episode occurs, restart ICS at low dose, and titrate up to a moderate dose as needed. Consider further trial without treatment in 12 months
- If suspected asthma is uncontrolled in children < 5 on a paediatric moderate dose of ICS as maintenance therapy (with SABA as needed), consider ICS + LTRA for a trial period of 8 to 12 weeks (unless there are side effects), then stop it if it is ineffective.
 
If suspected asthma is uncontrolled in children < 5 on a paediatric moderate dose ICS as maintenance therapy and a trial of an LTRA has been unsuccessful or not tolerated, stop the LTRA and refer the child to a specialist in asthma care for further investigation and management.
