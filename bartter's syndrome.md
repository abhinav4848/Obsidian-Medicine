Usually autosomal recessive.
Severe hypokalemia.
Due to defective chloride absorption at the Na+ K+ 2CI- cotransporter (NKCC2) in the ascending loop of Henle.

Associated with **normotension**.
	(unlike other endocrine causes of hypokalemia such as [[conn's syndrome]], [[cushing's syndrome]] and Liddle's syndrome that are associated with hypertension).

As Loop diuretics work by inhibiting NKCC2, think of Bartter's syndrome as like taking large doses of furosemide.
# Features:
Usually presents in childhood (Classic Bartter's), e.g. Failure to thrive.

Another major type is the **neonatal Bartter's syndrome** "seen between the gestational week 24-30 with excess amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios.). After birth, excessive polyuria andÂ  polydipsia with tendency to dehydration.
- Polyuria, polydipsia (think of it as like taking large doses of loop diuretics).
- [[Hypokalemia]] (low K+)
- Normotension (Normal BP). Or sometimes low BP but not high!
- Weakness.

# Treatment (Reading)
Sodium, chloride and potassium supplementation is necessary.
Spironolactone can be also used to reduce potassium loss.

Free access to water is necessary to prevent dehydration, as patients maintain an appropriate thirst response.
In severe cases where supplementation alone cannot maintain biochemical homeostasis, NSAIDs can be used to reduce GFR, prescribed with PPIs.

[[ace inhibitors|ACE]]- can also be used to reduce GFR
