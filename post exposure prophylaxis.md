# Hepatitis A  
- Human Normal Immunoglobulin (HNIG) or hepatitis A vaccine may be used depending on the clinical situation
    - HNIG is typically reserved for those who cannot receive the vaccine or where rapid protection is required (e.g. immunosuppressed individuals)
    - In most cases, **hepatitis A vaccine is preferred** for post-exposure prophylaxis

# Hepatitis B
- HBsAg positive source
    - If the person exposed is a **known responder** (anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/mL following full vaccination), a booster dose should be given
    - If they are a **non-responder** (anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL 1–2 months after completing the full course), they should receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and a booster vaccine
- Unknown source
    - For known responders, a booster dose may be considered depending on the risk assessment
    - For non-responders, **HBIG and a booster vaccine** should be given
    - Individuals undergoing a primary course of vaccination should complete an accelerated schedule and may be offered HBIG if the risk of exposure is considered high

# Hepatitis C
- There is **no effective post-exposure prophylaxis** for hepatitis C
- Initial testing should include baseline HCV serology and HCV RNA (PCR)
- Repeat HCV RNA at 6 and 12 weeks post-exposure, and HCV antibody at 3 and 6 months
- If seroconversion occurs, early referral to hepatology for consideration of **direct-acting antiviral therapy** is advised
  
# HIV
- The risk of HIV transmission depends on the nature of the exposure (e.g. needlestick, type of sexual contact, human bite) and the **viral load** of the source individual
- Low-risk incidents such as **human bites** generally do not require post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), unless blood is present or other risk factors apply
- First-line PEP regimen is oral antiretroviral therapy: **tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine (Truvada®) + raltegravir**
    - PEP should be started **as soon as possible** (ideally within 1–2 hours, and no later than 72 hours post-exposure)
    - Treatment course lasts **4 weeks**
- HIV serological testing is required at **12 weeks after completing PEP**
- PEP reduces the risk of HIV transmission by approximately **80%**

Varicella zoster  
- Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) should be given to **IgG-negative pregnant women or immunosuppressed individuals** after significant exposure
    - If VZIG is unavailable or >10 days post-exposure, **oral aciclovir** may be considered (based on risk assessment)

# Estimates of transmission risk for single needlestick injury

|Virus|Chance of transmission|
|---|---|
|Hepatitis B|20–30% (if source is HBeAg positive)|
|Hepatitis C|0.5–2%|
|HIV|0.3%|
