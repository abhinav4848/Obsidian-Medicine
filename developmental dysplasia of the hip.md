The head of femur can easily come out of the acetabulum -> Unstable joint -> Subluxation/Dislocation. 
Doesn't cause pain in the child but can lead to early hip replacement. 
# Risk factors
First fat female born oligo breech in a family with such history
	Firstborn, birth wt. > 5kgs, Girl child, oligohydramnios, breech presentation, family history,
Age < 3yo 
# Clinical Features
[[limping child|Limping]].
Painless leg that is shorter than the other. 
Unequal skin folds. 
### Exam: 
Barlow #named : attempt to dislocate an articulated femoral head. 
	Note: might be negative if hip is already dislocated at the time of presentation. 
Ortolani #named : relocate a dislocated femoral head. 

In infants older than 3 months, assessment by the Barlow and Ortolani tests is no longer sensitive. Perform the Galleazi sign to test for loss of abduction of the affected hip. 
# Investigation
Confirm with USG as although can be self resolving, it presents as a spectrum so can be bad as well. 
USG from 6 weeks up to 4.5 months cuz hips are cartilaginous. 
Xray only after 4.5 months. 
# Management 
Most unstable hips will spontaneously stabilize by 3-6 weeks. 
Pavlik harness #named(dynamic flexion abduction orthosis) in children <4-6 months

Other children: Surgery.
