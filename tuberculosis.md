# Risk
Loading bay, harbour > travel to endemic country.
Starting anyone on immunosuppressants like biologics, we do Quantiferon gold test to make sure they don't have latent tb. 

# Clinical Features
Cachexia (weight loss), chronic cough, hemoptysis, night sweat

# Investigation
**CXR**: Upper lobe infiltrates with cavitation.
Caseating granuloma #named  (non-caseating: [[Sarcoidosis]], [[inflammatory bowel disease|crohn's disease]])

Can do bronchoalveolar lavage > gastric lavage if sample not obtained.
(pleural tap done for u/l pleural effusion)

Mantoux used to diagnose only latent TB -> May be positive in patients with BCG vaccine.
- Interferon gamma release assay is used for TB detection in BCG vaccinated.
