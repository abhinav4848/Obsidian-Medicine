# Risk
Loading bay, harbour > travel to endemic country.
Starting anyone on immunosuppressants like biologics, we do Quantiferon gold test to make sure they don't have latent TB. 

# Clinical Features
Cachexia (weight loss), chronic cough, hemoptysis, night sweat
Can cause [[acute pericarditis]]. 

# Investigation
**CXR**: Upper lobe infiltrates with cavitation.
Caseating granuloma #named  (non-caseating: [[Sarcoidosis]], [[inflammatory bowel disease|Crohn's disease]])

Can do bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) > gastric lavage if sample not obtained.
(pleural tap done for u/l pleural effusion)

Mantoux used to diagnose only latent TB -> May be positive in patients with BCG vaccine.
- Interferon gamma release assay is used for TB detection in BCG vaccinated.

# Vaccine
BCG offers limited protection against TB. In UK, it's given to high-risk infants. 
	*See full list of who to give vaccine at the [Greenbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tuberculosis-the-green-book-chapter-32).* 
BCG is given intradermally. 
It contains live attenuated *Mycobacterium bovis*. It also offers limited protection against leprosy.  
#### Administration 
- any person being considered for the BCG vaccine must first be given a tuberculin skin test. The only exceptions are children < 6 years old who have had no contact with tuberculosis
- given intradermally, normally to the lateral aspect of the left upper arm
- BCG can be given at the same time as other live vaccines, but if not administered simultaneously there should be a 4 week interval
#### Contraindications
- previous BCG vaccination
- a past history of tuberculosis
- HIV
- pregnancy
- positive tuberculin test (Heaf or Mantoux)

The BCG vaccine is not given to anyone over the age of 35, as there is no evidence that it works for people of this age group.
