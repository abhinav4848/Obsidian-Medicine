#### Beta 2 agonists:
- SABA: salbutamol, terbutaline. 
- LABA: formoterol, salmeterol. 
	- *See [[asthma- drugs]].* 
#### Beta blockers:
- Bisoprolol, Atenolol

# Site specific action
### Lung
- Bronchodilation
### Heart
- Vasodilation -> Mild decrease in diastolic BP
- Reflex tachycardia
- Used in [[heart failure]]. 
### Skeletal muscle 
- Beta 2 receptors -> Increased K+ uptake -> [[hypokalemia]]
- Contraction -> May cause tremor, mainly to hands. 
### Liver 
- Beta 2 stimulation -> Glycogenolysis -> transient [[hyperglycemia]]
	- (So beta blockers can cause [[hypoglycemia]]). 
### Other smooth muscles
- **Gut:** relaxation → slowed peristalsis
- **Bladder / ureter:** relaxation. Beta 3. ([[incontinence- adult|Mirabegron]] for Urge incontinence)
- **Vascular beds:** peripheral vasodilation (hands/feet → sometimes flushing)
### Uterus 
- used historically as tocolytics
