A kerion is an abscess caused by dermatophytes (tinea)
It's a boggy, inflammatory, pustular mass that arises as a result of a severe inflammatory reaction to a fungal infection, happening most often on scalp, face, upper limbs.
- Treat urgently, risk of scarring [[alopecia]]. 

Can be confused for bacterial infection
Difference: #confusion Bacterial abscesses tend to be more localized and painful compared to kerions
