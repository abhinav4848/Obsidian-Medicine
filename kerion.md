A kerion is a boggy, inflammatory, pustular mass that arises as a result of a severe inflammatory reaction to a fungal infection, typically caused by dermatophytes such as *Trichophyton* or *Microsporum* species.  
Treat urgently, risk of scarring [[alopecia]]. 

diff: #confusion Bacterial abscesses tend to be more localized and painful compared to kerions
