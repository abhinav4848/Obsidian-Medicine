[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] has seropositivity as RF present. 
# Seronegative arthritis
Features: 
- Lack of Rheumatoid factor & Anti-CCP (seronegative)
- [[hla-b27|HLA-B27]] association. 

Group includes
1. [[Ankylosing spondylitis]]: Anterior [[uveitis]]
2. [[Reactive arthritis]]: Conjunctivitis.
3. [[behcet's disease]] 
4. Arthritis that accompanies [[inflammatory bowel disease|IBD]]
5. [[whipple disease]] 
6. psoriatic arthritis

Based on site commonly affected, they can be divided into predominantly axial or predominantly peripheral.

# Inflammatory arthritis (Not seronegative arthritis)
 - Crystal induced arthritis: [[gout]], [[pseudogout]] (Inflammatory but not autoimmune)
 - Connective tissue disease related: [[systemic lupus erythematosis|SLE]] (Photosensitivity), [[sjogren's syndrome|Sjögren Syndrome]], [[systemic sclerosis]], Mixed connective tissue disorder
 - Infective: [[septic arthritis]], post-viral (e.g. parvovirus)

# Investigation
See [[antibodies]]. 
First test: do RF  & ANA (for connective tissue disease)
# Treatments
**NSAID**: Rheumatoid arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, Reactive arthritis, [[Gout]].
**Steroid**: Sarcoidosis, Churg-Strauss, Wegener, GCA, Polymyositis, Dermatomyositis, Polymyalgia rheumatica. 

>[!warning]-
>Axial presentations of spondyloarthritis are often misdiagnosed as mechanical low back pain, leading to delays in access to effective treatments. Peripheral presentations are often seen as unrelated joint or tendon problems, and can be misdiagnosed because problems can move around between joints
