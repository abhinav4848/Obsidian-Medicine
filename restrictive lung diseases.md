# Causes
## Interstitial
Lung tissue is damaged. All these conditions reduce 
- Pneumoconiosis: Coal, Silicosis, Asbestosis
- [[lung fibrosis|Pulmonary fibrosis]] ([[interstitial lung disease vs pneumonitis|ILD]])
- [[Sarcoidosis]]
- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis- immune reaction to small particles: bird droppings, mould, dust
## Extra-pulmonary
Structures around lungs are damaged- prevents chest expansion
- Neuromuscular disorder (MND, Myasthenia gravis, Diaphragm weakness)
- Severe obesity- puts too much pressure on chest making it difficult to expand
- Kyphoscoliosis e.g. [[ankylosing spondylitis]]
- Pectus excavatum
- Pleural effusion
- ARDS
- Infant RDS

# Clinical features
Reduced TLC, FEV1, FVC
But FEV1:FVC stay same or increases

In ILD, Fibrosis in the lung leads to pulmonary HTN which leads to RVH -> cor pulmonale.
