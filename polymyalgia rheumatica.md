# PMR
**PMR**: CK Normal, ESR > 30, CRP > 6

***[[Polymyositis]]**: Raised CK & ALP -> Could walk before, can't walk now.*

PMR is an inflammatory condition causing pain and stiffness to shoulder/neck & pelvic girdle. 
## Clinical Features
Age typically > 50 years old, women, Caucasian. 
Features should be present for >= 2 weeks to make the diagnosis. 

Rapid onset (<1 month), symmetrical symptoms. 
Morning ache & stiffness. 
- of proximal muscles (neck, shoulder, upper arm, pelvic girdle)
- Pain interferes with sleep. 
- Profound stiffness in joints, esp in the morning lasting up to 45 mins. 
Muscles are tender, not weak.
- The weakness is due to myalgia (pain inhibition i.e. subjective weakness present but not objective weakness). 
- Pain improves on passive motion of joint. 

## Investigation
ESR, plasma viscosity, CRP
- Normal inflammatory markers don't rule out PMR. 
**Baseline**: 
	FBC, U&e, LFT, [[Calcium]], serum protein electrophoresis ([[multiple myeloma|myeloma]]), TSH, CK (myositis), Rheumatoid factor, Urine dip stick. 
**Additional**: 
	ANA (SLE), Anti-CCP (RA), Urine Bence Jones proteins (myeloma), CXR (lung pathologies which may be associated with [[dermatomyositis]], mediastinal abnormalities)
## Treatment
[[corticosteroid|steroid]]: prednisolone e.g. 15mg/OD
- patients typically respond dramatically to steroids
- No response in a week- should prompt consideration of an alternative diagnosis
- if some response in a week- reassess in 3-4 weeks. Expect benefit of 70% in symptoms & inflammatory markers back to normal. 
- then can make working diagnosis of PMR & start reducing steroids. 
- 15mg till symptoms controlled  -> 12.5 for 3w -> 10mg for 4-6w -> decrease by 1mg every 4-6w
- If symptoms start returning on the reducing regime, increase & stay on the dose longer. 
- Can take 1-2 years to fully wean the patient off steroids. 
- If needing steroid for > 2 years, or difficulty weaning off, or difficulty controlling, refer to rheumatologist

# Temporal arteritis
PMR is associated with Giant cell arteritis 
GCA rarely happens to people under 60 years old.
## Treatment
Responds dramatically to steroids.
- Give [[corticosteroid|Prednisolone]] 60mg/d with taper, 
	- Low dose aspirin, 
	- [[bisphosphonates]] to prevent [[osteoporosis]]. 
	- PPI for gastroprotection
- If no improvement in 1 week, increase steroid dose and re-review in another week. If still no improvement, consider other diagnosis.
