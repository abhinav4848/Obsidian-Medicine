# Pelvic Inflammatory disease
## Clinical Features
Pelvic exam findings:
1. Cervical motion tenderness (cervical excitation), 
2. Adnexal tenderness (b/l usually), 
Elevated temperature (mild/chronic infection)

**Others**: Lower abdominal pain, #Fever, menstrual irregularity, vaginal/cervical discharge.

Due to Chlamydia > Gonorrhoea.
- Pelvic USG if abscess suspected.

**Investigation**
- Do NAAT with vulvovaginal swab > endocervical swab.
- High vaginal swab is helpful in recurrent symptoms, treatment failure, pregnancy, post-partum, post-abortion, post-instrumentation.
- If a woman is asymptomatic, she can do a self administered VV swab.
- If abscess suspected, do Pelvic USG.

[NICE CKS PID](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/)
Chlamydia trachomatis > Nisseria gonorrhoea. 
Their vaginal discharge is not foul smelling. Presents mostly asymptomatically.

Treat with abx based on history & exam alone. Do swabs but don't wait for results.
Do a pregnancy test.
## Cervicitis
Most sensitive screening test for C & G is self-collected vulvovaginal swab for NAAT -> especially for h/o intermenstrual bleeding & post-coital bleeding. 

### [[Chlamydia]] trachomatis (y for y) #mnemonic 
Doxycycline, or
(if pregnant, give Amoxicillin, Azithromycin, clarithromycin, or Erythromycin instead)

### Neisseria [[gonorrhoea]] (C for C) #mnemonic 
Ceftriaxone 1 gm IM (Single dose), or #abx 
[[Ciprofloxacin]] 500mg PO (single dose)

### PID 
(metronidazole is essential in all cases) *MO* or *CMD* for *PID*
- Outpatient -> MO: *Oral Metronidazole + Oral Ofloxacin, or CMD*
- Inpatient -> CMD: *IM Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole + Doxycycline*  
  
Doxycycline is 1st line in [[lyme disease|Lyme disease]] (but if pregnant, use amoxicillin) & Chlamydia cervicitis.
## Complication
- Perihepatitis ([[fitz-hugh-curtis syndrome|Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome]])
