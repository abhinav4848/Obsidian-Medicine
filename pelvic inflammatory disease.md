# Pelvic Inflammatory disease
## Aetiology
BV & Trichomonas are related to PID but don't cause PID themselves. 

Due to ascending [[Chlamydia]] > [[Gonorrhoea]] from [[cervicitis|Cervicitis]]
- Pelvic USS if abscess suspected.

Chlamydia trachomatis > Nisseria gonorrhoea. 
Their vaginal discharge is not foul smelling. Presents mostly asymptomatically.
## Clinical Features
Pelvic exam findings:
1. Cervical motion tenderness (cervical excitation), 
2. Adnexal tenderness (b/l usually), 
Elevated temperature (mild/chronic infection) #fever 

**Others**: Lower abdominal pain, menstrual irregularity, vaginal/cervical discharge.
## Investigation
- Do NAAT with vulvovaginal swab > endocervical swab.
- High vaginal swab is helpful in recurrent symptoms, treatment failure, pregnancy, post-partum, post-abortion, post-instrumentation.
- If a woman is asymptomatic, she can do a self administered VV swab.
- If abscess suspected, do Pelvic USG.
# Treatment
Treat with abx based on history & exam alone. 
Do swabs but don't wait for results.
Do a pregnancy test.

(metronidazole is essential in all cases) *MO* or *CMD* for *PID*
- Outpatient -> MO: *Oral Metronidazole + Oral Ofloxacin, or CMD*
- Inpatient -> CMD: *IM Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole + Doxycycline*  
  
Doxycycline is 1st line in [[lyme disease|Lyme disease]] (but if pregnant, use amoxicillin) & Chlamydia cervicitis.
## Complication
- Perihepatitis ([[fitz-hugh-curtis syndrome|Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome]])
