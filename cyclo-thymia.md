Cyclothymia (cyclothymic disorder) is a chronic mood disorder characterised by long-term mood instability with recurrent hypomanic symptoms and mild depressive symptoms that do not meet full criteria for hypomania or major depressive episodes.
# Key features
- **Duration:**
    - ≥ **2 years** in adults (≥ 1 year in children/adolescents)
- **Mood pattern:**
    - Fluctuations between:
        - **Hypomanic symptoms** (↑ energy, reduced sleep, talkative, impulsive)
        - **Subthreshold depressive symptoms** (low mood, anhedonia, fatigue)
- **Symptom-free periods:**
    - No symptom-free interval longer than **2 months**
- **Severity:**
    - Symptoms are **persistent but milder** than bipolar I or II
- **Functional impact:**
    - Causes distress or interpersonal/occupational impairment
# What it is _not_
- **Not bipolar I:** no full manic episodes
- **Not bipolar II:** no major depressive episodes
- **Not normal moodiness:** persistence and pattern over years is key
- **Not substance- or medical-induced** 
# Clinical relevance
- Often **under-recognised** or mislabelled as personality traits
- Can **progress to bipolar I or II**
- Antidepressants alone may **destabilise mood**
# Management (high level)
- **Psychoeducation**
- **Mood stabilisers** (e.g. [[lithium]], valproate) if functionally impairing
- **Psychotherapy** (CBT, interpersonal therapy)
