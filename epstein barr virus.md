Aka Mono/glandular fever -> Seen in adolescents.

# Clinical Features
**Triad**: Fever, pharyngitis (sore throat), Cervical LNE (other sites also)-> exudative tonsils.Â 
	In [[tonsillitis]] -> Only anterior chain of LN affected
	In EBV-> Both anterior & posterior chain of LN affected.
Hepatosplenomegaly, Jaundice -> Anaemia.
	Transient rise in ALT. 
	Jaundice in mono is because of hemolysis secondary to cold agglutinins (IgM).
	Thus Anaemia is common also.
Palatal petechiae 
Neutropenia & lymphocytosis (at least 10% atypical lymphocytes).

In IMN (Glandular fever), the most likely organ to be involved is -> Spleen
	A swollen spleen does not present any immediate health problems, but it increases the risk of the spleen rupturing (splitting). The main sign of a ruptured spleen is the sudden onset of a sharp abdominal (tummy) pain.

IN HIV, EBV can cause [[hairy Leukoplakia]]. 
[[_cancer- ent|nasopharyngeal cancer]], Burkitt Lymphoma. #associated 
Ampicillin/amoxicillin leads to rash.
# Investigation
Paul Bunnel/Monospot/heterophile antibody test -> Do FBC & Monospot in 2nd week of illness to confirm diagnosis. #named 
# Treatment
