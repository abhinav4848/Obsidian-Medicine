Oral ketoconazole is associated with serious hepatotoxicity, including fatal cases of liver failure. In the UK, oral ketoconazole is no longer recommended as a first-line treatment for any fungal infection due to its risk of liver injury and drug interactions. 

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has advised that oral ketoconazole should only be used when other antifungal treatments are not suitable or have failed.
