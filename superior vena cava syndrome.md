Although presentation of SVC syndrome can be impressive, it is rarely an emergency.
# Causes
88% of causes are malignant & in 50% of those cases, SVCO can be the first manifestation. 
The most common malignant causes of SVC syndrome are 
1. [[cancer- lung|non-small-cell lung cancer]], 
2. small-cell lung cancer, 
3. non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 
4. metastatic lesions.

# Classic Symptoms
Edema of the head, neck, and arms, often with cyanosis, and distended subcutaneous vessels. SVC syndrome may also cause the following signs and symptoms:
- cough
- hoarseness
- dyspnoea- breathlessness is a very common complaint. Symptoms may be exacerbated by bending forward or lying down. 
- stridor
- syncope
- headache/head-fullness
- confusion
- Swelling of face and arm due to elevation of venous pressure above the obstruction. Cyanosed appearance is due to delay in draining of deoxygenated blood rather than central hypoxia, which, if also present, is usually due to the effects of any underlying lung disease. 

Onset is insidious which allows collaterals to develop, visible as engorged veins.
