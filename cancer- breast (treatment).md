# Investigation
Suspicious breast lump: FNAC -> Core biopsy. 
-> invasive intraductal carcinoma of the breast extending to the epithelium. 

# Treatment
## Hormonal
- Only done for ER+ tumours.
- [[cancer- gynaecology (medications)|Tamoxifen]] for pre and peri menopausal women up-to 5 years.
- Aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole) in post menopausal as this is how most E is formed post-menopausally.
## Biological
- Must be HER2+ve.
- Trastuzumab (Herceptin) -> but can't use if h/o heart disorders.
## Surgical
- If no palpable axillary LN -> USG of LN -> If this also negative -> Sentinel node biopsy.
- If palpable LN -> LN clearance at primary surgery.
- Depending on the characteristic of tumour, either Wide Local (e.g. DCIS <4cm) or Mastectomy is done.

## Radiotherapy
- If WLE -> Whole breast radiotherapy
- If mastectomy -> radiotherapy for T3, T4 tumours & >=4 +ve axillary LN.

## Chemo
- Can be neo or adjuvant to surgery.
- if there is axillary node disease - FEC-D is used in this situation.
