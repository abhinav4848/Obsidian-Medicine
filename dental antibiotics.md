For acute dental and gum infections, examples of suitable antibiotics include (adult doses) for 5 days:  
- amoxicillin 500mg 8-hourly orally, or,
- metronidazole 400mg 8-hourly orally, or,
- if penicillin allergic: clarithromycin 500mg 12-hourly orally  
  
- Clindamycin is an alternative for severe infection but there is concomitant risk of developing [[c. difficile|Clostridium difficile]] associated diarrhoea

All patients should be advised they must seek a dentist's advice as these are only emergency measures.
# NICE
NICE CKS has specific guidance on this: https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/dental-abscess/management/management/

- **Antibiotics are generally not indicated for otherwise healthy people at low risk of complications when there are no signs of spreading infection.** In the absence of immediate attention by a dentist, only prescribe an antibiotic:
    - For people who are systemically unwell or if there are signs of severe infection (for example fever, lymphadenopathy, cellulitis, diffuse swelling).
    - For high-risk individuals to reduce the risk of complications (for example people who are immunocompromised or have diabetes).
- **If an oral antibiotic is indicated:**
    - Prescribe either phenoxymethylpenicillin or amoxicillin. If the person has a _true_ penicillin allergy, prescribe metronidazole or a macrolide such as clarithromycin.
    - Consider concomitant treatment with metronidazole if the infection is severe or spreading (lymph node involvement, or systemic signs such as fever or malaise).

# Personal anecdotes
1. Just to add to this from a personal experience if you give them abx, dentist will refuse to see them until they complete the course of abx first. Dentists also have emergency coverage for OOH exactly as GPs, so patient can make urgent appt if needed. So I stick to the CKS advice, will only prescribe abx if systemically unwell, otherwise will do them a favour and not proscribe abx, so dentists will have no excuse to delay seeing them!
2. Guys I have a recent real life example from my practice: A patient came in with suspected dental infection, GP out of courtesy gave some Abxs and advised him to see dentist urgently. Patient felt better and didn't go to dentist . 10 days later , ended up with invasive abscess onto ICU and died. Family successfully sued the GP and MDU couldn't cover him either . Despite documenting advice to see dentist. Therefore to all the courtesy heroes out there , you have no right to venture into dentist's territory without adequate training . Send them to A&E for max fax if systemically unwell . Your career is on line
