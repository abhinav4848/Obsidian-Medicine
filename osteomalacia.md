Literally means "soft bones".
Called rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults. 
# Pathophysiology
It’s a disorder of defective bone mineralisation in adults, usually due to vitamin D deficiency or problems in its metabolism.

When Vit D (or Phosphate) is deficient, 
- Ca & Phosphate fall
- Leads to secondary [[hyperparathyroidism]]. 
- PTH increases bone turnover to maintain calcium levels but new bone is poorly mineralised. 

# Causes
### Vitamin D deficiency
- Low sunlight exposure (elderly, veiled, institutionalised)
- Malabsorption ([[coeliac disease]], [[inflammatory bowel disease|Crohn's disease]])
- Liver disease (impaired 25-hydroxylation)
- CKD-4 or 5 (impaired 1-α hydroxylation -> renal osteodystrophy)
- Poor diet (rare, unless vegan without supplementation)
### Phosphate deficiency
- Fanconi syndrome (renal phosphate wasting)
- Oncogenic osteomalacia (tumour secreting FGF-23)
- Aluminium toxicity (from old dialysis)
### Drug-induced
- Anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine- induce hepatic metabolism of vitamin D)
- Antifungals, 
- Retrovirals
- Bisphosphonates or fluoride (rare)

# Biochemistry
- ALP raised
- Vit D low
- Phosphate low (as low vit D -> low calcium -> secondary [[hyperparathyroidism]] -> Low Phosphate)
