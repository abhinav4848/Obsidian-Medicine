Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a chronic, localized, bone remodelling disorder characterized by increased bone resorption, bone formation, and remodelling, which may lead to major long bone and skull deformities.
	Affected region is warmer due to increased blood flow. Also leads to high output HF.

# Clinical Features
Knee pain, back pain, kyphosis, hearing loss (due to 8th nerve affected in Paget of skull).

# Imaging
**X-ray:** Cortical sclerosis, coarse trabecular pattern.
- Blade of grass lesion: #named  V-shape pattern b/w healthy & diseased long bone
- Cotton wool appearance: Multifocal sclerotic patches in skull (myeloma has lytic: pepper pot appearance). See: *[[biochemical differences in different ortho conditions]]* 
- Sabre tibia: Bowing of tibia.
- Frontal bossing of skull
