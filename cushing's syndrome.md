## ACTH dependent
Cushing disease: (Pituitary adenoma) Excess ACTH released that affects both adrenals -> b/l adrenal hyperplasia.
Carcinoid tumours.

## ACTH independent
Adrenal adenoma, adrenal carcinoma, Excess steroid administration

# Clinical Features
Features like aldosterone: [[Hypernatremia|excess Na]], [[hypokalemia|low K]]. 

Hyperpigmentation in case of ACTH secreting tumour (ACTH dependent Cushing syndrome)- also seen in [[addison's disease|Addison's]].

Refractory HTN despite >2 drugs
# Investigate:
**Outpatient**: 24 hr. urinary free cortisol
**Best for diagnosis**: low dose overnight dexamethasone suppression test
	if ACTH not suppressed, Cushing.
	If ACTH suppressed, Pituitary is normal.
To localize lesion (pituitary adenoma vs ectopic): High dose

An insulin stress test is used to differentiate between true Cushing's and pseudo-Cushing's.
