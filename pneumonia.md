# Clinical features 
- Cough, Sputum production, fever, old age
- Atypical pneumonia infects interstitial space instead of alveoli, hence has dry cough.
- Typical Pneumonia has productive cough, more rapid onset, high fever, and is usually caused by Strep -> MCC of CAP. 

## Investigations  
- chest x-ray
- in intermediate or high-risk patients NICE recommend blood and sputum cultures, pneumococcal and legionella urinary antigen tests
- CRP monitoring is recommend for admitted patients to help determine response to treatment.

# Types
## 1. [[Haemophilus influenzae]]
Especially common in patients with [[COPD]] -> Presents as acute exacerbation of COPD. 
Reduced occurrence in children due to Hib vaccine but can cause [[acute epiglottitis]] in them. 

---
## 2. Hospital acquired pneumonia
[[Co-trimoxazole]] #abx 

---
## 3. Klebsiella pneumoniae
Generally seen in malnourished alcoholics, diabetics, elderly.
CXR: Cavitating pneumonia of upper lobes. 

---
## 4. Legionella pneumophilia
Seen in hotel, tours. Foreign holidays. Exposure to common source of water or air conditioning. 
Another one of the atypical pneumonias.
### Clinical Features
- **Hyponatremia** (due to SIADH)-> can cause patients presenting as confused.
- Lymphocytopenia
- Hypoalbuminemia
- Deranged LFT
- Flu-like symptoms, dry cough, relative bradycardia, confusion
### Investigation
Urinary antigen
**CXR**: patchy Bi-basal consolidation
### Treatment
Macrolides (Clarithromycin > Azithromycin) or tetracycline #abx 

---
## 5. Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Common in young adult, 
Prolonged and gradual onset
Worsening flu like symptoms precede a dry cough
### Complications
- [[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] ([[ITP]]) due to Cold agglutinins (IgM),
- [[erythema multiforme]], Erythema nodosum
	Erythe`ma` multiforme: Mycoplas`ma`
- **Bullous myringitis**: painful vesicles on the tympanic membrane
##### Less imp points
• Meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and other immune-mediated neurological diseases
• Patients aren't as septic. 
• Hyponatremia common in any pneumonia (but more in Legionella)
• Deranged LFT, 
• Peri/Myocarditis
• Acute glomerulonephritis
### Inv
• CXR: Atypical chest signs/x-ray findings. Reticular-nodular shadowing or patchy consolidation of 1 lower lobe
• Serology for diagnosis. 
### Treatment
Doxycycline or a macrolide (e.g. erythro/clarithromycin preferred in atypicals in general) #abx

---
## 6. Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (PCP)
Yeast like fungus.  
Generally seen in patients with **[[HIV]] (CD4 < 200)**.
Presents with a dry cough, exercise-induced desaturations and the absence of chest signs

CXR: b/l consolidation, b/l perihilar interstitial shadow
### Treatment
If CD < 200: Co-trimoxazole as prophylaxis. #abx
If CD < 50: Azithromycin (prophylaxis against M. avium)

---
## 7. [[Pseudomonas]]	
Causes LRTI in [[Cystic fibrosis]], 2nd decade onwards. 

---
## 8. Staphylococcus aureus
Often occurs following influenza infection. (Use [[Amantadine]] to treat influenza virus)
Also in iv drug abusers, elderly.
Blood streaked sputum, pleuritic chest pain.

CXR: b/l lower lobe cavitation.

---
## 9. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)
Herpes `L`abialis-> Streptococca`L`
Commonest cause of pneumonia: Accounts for 80% of cases. 
u/l basal crackles, u/l lobar consolidation -> Lobar pneumonia. 
### CXR
lobar consolidation

Productive cough, fever, chest tightness.
Especially associated with high fever, rapid onset and herpes labialis
A vaccine to pneumococcal is available. 
### Vaccination
[UK.gov Green Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pneumococcal-the-green-book-chapter-25), [[immunisation in adults|adult vaccination]] 
The pneumococcal vaccine is routinely offered to infants, those aged > 65, and patients with other health conditions that put them at high risk. e.g. Asthmatic requiring steroids at doses high enough to cause immunosuppression. #vaccine

# 10. Community Acquired Pneumonia %%is linked%%
Pneumonia that is acquired outside hospital, or within 48 hours of admission. Pneumonia that develops in a nursing home resident is included in this definition.

From [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs110/chapter/Quality-statement-3-Duration-of-initial-antibiotic-treatment): Prescribe 5 day abx for adults with CAP or HAP, or 3 days for children 3 months to 11 years, if non-severe symptoms. 

### Recovery course
In Pneumonia, how quickly should symptoms resolve: 

|Time|Progress|
|---|---|
|1 week|Fever should have resolved|
|4 weeks|Chest pain and sputum production should have substantially reduced|
|6 weeks|Cough and breathlessness should have substantially reduced|
|3 months|Most symptoms should have resolved but fatigue may still be present|
|6 months|Most people will feel back to normal.|
All cases of pneumonia should have a repeat chest X-ray at 6 weeks after clinical resolution to ensure that the consolidation has resolved and there is no underlying secondary abnormalities (e.g. a lung tumour). It's often arranged by the X-Ray department itself.
