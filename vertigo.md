A head impulse test is performed on symptomatic patients (ie. vertigo, nausea, vomiting) to differentiate between peripheral and central causes of their vertigo.

If test positive (ie. there's a catchup saccade due to abnormal vestibulo-ocular reflex), then the cause of vertigo is peripheral, which is reassuring.

If negative, then cause of vertigo is central, which is worrisome.

Other findings that may indicate central causes is bidirectional nystagmus.
