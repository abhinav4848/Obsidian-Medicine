**Persistent haematuria**: 2 out of 3 dipsticks positive for blood on separate occasions.  

# Refer urgently to exclude urological cancer if
see ![[haematuria.canvas|haematuria]]
- Infection is not confirmed on culture with visible haematuria. 
- Visible haematuria persists after infection has been successfully treated. 
- Non-visible haematuria persists after infection has been successfully treated in a person more than 50 years of age. 
- Visible or non-visible haematuria + persistent/recurrent [[UTI]] in a woman aged >=40yo. 

# Non-cancer treatments
If non-visible haematuria persists after infection has been successfully treated in a woman less than 50 years of age, test the urine albumin/creatinine ratio (abnormal if >= 30 mg/mmol) and measure serum creatinine levels.  
- If there is proteinuria or a declining or low eGFR (<30 ml/min/1.73m2), refer to a renal physician.
- If there is no proteinuria and eGFR is normal, refer non-urgently to a urologist.
