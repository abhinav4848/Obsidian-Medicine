# Venous thromoboembolism
Length of warfarin treatment
1. Provoked (e.g. recent surgery): 3 months
2. Unprovoked: 6 months
#### If DVT likely on Wells >= 2
Do Scan, if not available, do D-Dimer.

|               | D-Dimer +ve                                                                   | D-Dimer -ve   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Scan +ve      | DVT confirmed                                                                 | DVT confirmed |
| Scan -ve      | stop DOAC & repeat scan 6-8 days later                                        | DVT ruled out |
| Scan not done | start interim Apixaban/ Rivaroxaban while waiting for proximal leg vein scan. |               |
##### If DVT unlikely on Wells: 1
Do Dimer. If not available, start DOAC.
If D-Dimer: 
	+ve: Offer Scan (See above table)
	-ve: Consider alternative diagnosis 
###### Duration
Provoked: 3 months
Unprovoked: 6 months if ORBIT score says low bleeding risk
###### Treatment
DOAC ([[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|Avoid in pregnancy]]/breastfeeding/CrCl < 15) -> LMWH.
###### Exception
Superficial vein thrombosis (aka superficial thrombophlebitis) of the long saphenous vein has the risk of becoming deep vein thrombosis so whenever a patient comes with it, get an ultrasound right away cuz high risk of DVT and anyway this condition has raised D-Dimer so no need of that.

-----------------
# D-Dimer elevation
- Superficial thrombophlebitis: no pain on movement
- DVT: Homan's sign; pain on dorsiflexion of ankle
- Elevated post surgery.

Well's Score >=2 or <2.
# DVT management
1. commence pt. on DOAC unless he already is on one.
2. Arrange USG within 24 hrs.
3. Request d-dimer if USG delayed, or if well score <2. if d dimer +ve -> USG.
