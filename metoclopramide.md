Has complimentary [[antiemetics|anti-emetic]] effects due to action on two different receptors:
- [[d2 antagonism|D2-receptor antagonist]] (Avoid in Parkinson's)
- Acts on [[5-ht receptors (serotonin receptors)|Serotonin receptor]] that helps with anti-emetic effect. 
	- 5-HT3 antagonist
	- 5-HT4 agonist
Non-sedating. 
Useful in impaired gastric emptying (gastroparesis).  
# Uses 
- Central anti-emetic effect on [[areas of brain|area postrema]] (an area just outside the BBB that contains CTZ)
- D2 antagonism, 5-HT4 agonism in GIT -> Increased Ach release in myenteric plexus -> Prokinetic effect in upper GIT (useful in diabetic and post-surgery gastroparesis). 
	- Good for nausea due to gastric stasis. 
- Hyperemesis gravidarum
- Symptomatic relief of acute migraine, chemotherapy or radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. 
- Subacute bowel obstruction
	- Prokinetics like metoclopramide are actually used in sub-acute bowel obstruction as they can prevent progression to complete obstruction - so unless you are concerned about acute obstruction then fine to go ahead.
# Side effects
1. Crosses BBB- In young people can cause [[extrapyramidal side-effects|acute dystonia]] due to EPS effect (drug-induced [[parkinson's disease|parkinsonism]]), e.g.: Oculogyric crisis.
	1. The FDA recommends that metoclopramide be used at low doses and for less than 12 weeks because the risk of [[extrapyramidal side-effects|drug-induced movement disorders]] (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, akathisia) is increased with high-doses and prolonged therapy.
2. Can cause hyperprolactinemia & nipple discharge but not [[gynaecomastia]].
3. Lowers seizure threshold. 
4. Avoid in suspected small bowel obstruction
5. Avoid combining with [[digoxin]] and [[antidiabetic drugs]].
