# Diagnosis of COPD
 A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in patients over the age of 35 who have a risk factor (generally a [[smoking]] history of greater than 20 pack years) and who present with one or more of the following symptoms:
1. Exertional breathlessness (MRC scale)
2. Chronic cough
3. Regular sputum production >3 months.
4. Frequent winter 'bronchitis' wheeze
## vs Asthma
Night time waking with breathlessness and/or wheeze is more [[asthma]].
Significant diurnal or day-to-day variability of symptoms is more asthma.
Symptoms in age <35 are more common in asthma.
