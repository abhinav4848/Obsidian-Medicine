# Diagnosis of COPD
 A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in patients over the age of 35 who have a risk factor (generally a [[smoking]] history of greater than 20 pack years) and who present with one or more of the following symptoms:
1. Exertional breathlessness (MRC scale)
2. Chronic cough
3. Regular sputum production >3 months.
4. Frequent winter 'bronchitis' wheeze

Night time waking with breathlessness and/or wheeze is more asthma.
Significant diurnal or day-to-day variability of symptoms is more asthma.
Symptoms in age <35 are more common in asthma.
## Spirometry Criteria
See: [[spirometry#COPD]]
## Imaging
Hyperinflated lung
More than 7 posterior ribs seen
Flat diaphragm
Small heart
May see bullae

# LTOT
LTOT: long term O2 therapy for 15 hrs. a day
## When to assess need for LTOT
- FEV1 <30% of predicted. i.e. Very severe airflow obstruction
- SpO2 < 92% on room air
- Cyanosis
- Polycythemia
- Peripheral edema
- Raised JVP
## Conditions for assessment
- Patient should be stable > 5 weeks since last COPD exacerbation
- His therapy for COPD is fully optimized
- 2 sets ABG 3 weeks apart show him hypoxic

## Offer LTOT
pO2 < 7.3 kPa
pO2 of 7.3 - 8 kPa & any of:
- Secondary polycythemia
- Peripheral edema
- Pulmonary HTN

If already on LTOT but still breathless -> Prednisolone/nebulized NS to loosen secretions. Can also give carbocisteine for secretions although excess drug can cause excessive loose secretions. LVR (lung volume recruitment) bags help get enough air in to generate a cough.
