| [[Developmental dysplasia of the hip]]            | Usually diagnosed in infancy by screening tests. May be bilateral.  When disease is unilateral, there may be leg length inequality. <br><br>As disease progresses child may limp and then early onset arthritis. More common in extended breech babies. | Splints and harnesses or traction. In later years osteotomy and hip realignment procedures may be needed. In arthritis a joint replacement may be needed. <br><br>However, this is best deferred if possible as it will almost certainly require revision | Initially no obvious change on plain films and USS gives best resolution until 3 months of age. On plain films Shenton's line #named should form a smooth arc           |
| [[legg-calve-perthe's disease\|Perthe's Disease]] | Hip pain (may be referred to the knee) usually occurring between 5 and 12 years of age. Bilateral disease in 20%.                                                                                                                                       | Remove pressure from joint to allow normal development. Physiotherapy. Usually self-limiting if diagnosed and treated promptly.                                                                                                                           | X-rays will show flattened femoral head. Eventually in untreated cases the femoral head will fragment.                                                                  |
| [[Slipped upper femoral epiphysis]]               | Typically seen in obese male adolescents. **Pain** is often referred to the knee. Limitation to internal rotation is usually seen. Knee pain is usually present 2 months prior to hip slipping. Bilateral in 20%.                                       | Bed rest and non-weight bearing. Aim to avoid avascular necrosis. If severe slippage or risk of it occurring then percutaneous pinning of the hip may be required.                                                                                        | X-rays will show the femoral head displaced and falling inferolaterally (like a melting ice cream cone) The Southwick angle #named gives indication of disease severity |
