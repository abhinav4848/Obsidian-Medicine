# DDx
BRVO: Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).
this occurs when a vein in the distal retinal venous system is occluded and is thought to occur due to blockage of retinal veins at arteriovenous crossings. It results in a more limited area of the fundus being affected.

## Treatment
indications for treatment in patients with CRVO include:
	Macular oedema - intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents
