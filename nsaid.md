# Avoid NSAID in
- pregnants cuz PDA.
- if gastric bleeding, already on blood thinners.
- CHF, IHD, CKD, [[Asthma]]. 
	- NSAIDs reduce PGs -> renal efferent constriction -> 
		- Na & Fluid retention: CHF
		- AKI, reduced glomerular filtration: CKD
	- NSAIDs reduce PGs -> arachidonic acid shunted to Leukotriene production: 
		- Selective COX-2 inhibitors -> PGI2 from COX-2 is reduced -> Relative excess of thromboxane: IHD
		- PGs dilate airway, leukotrienes constrict
## NSAID & CHF
- NSAIDs inhibit renal prostaglandins -> Afferent arteriole vasoconstriction
- Decreased renal perfusion -> decreased Na & H2O excretion
- Sodium & Water retention -> Worsening Edema, Raised BP, Decompensates HF
## NSAID & IHD
- Cox-2 inhibition -> Decreased PGI2 (PGI2 is vasodilator & anti-platelet)
- Relative excess of thromboxane -> pro-thrombotic state
- Increased risk of MI, Stroke
## NSAID & CKD
- PGIs maintain afferent arteriole dilation
- NSAIDs inhibit PGs -> afferent arteriole constriction -> reduced intraglomerular pressure
- Dangerous with: 
	- Dehydration
	- Elderly
	- Triple whammy. Kidney catastrophe. #mnemonic 
		- NSAID: afferent
		- [[ace inhibitors|ACE inhibitor]]: efferent
		- Thiazide: reduce flow
- Leads to AKI, Progressive CKD, [[hyperkalemia]], Na & water retention
## NSAID & Asthma
Whether NSAID can be given in [[asthma]] depends on the type of asthma and the patient’s history with NSAIDs.
- NSAIDs (like ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac) can trigger bronchospasm in a subset of asthmatics- this is known as NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD) or aspirin-sensitive asthma.
	- This occurs in roughly 10-20% of adults with asthma, especially those who also have nasal polyps or chronic rhinosinusitis. See [[Samter's triad]]. 
- The mechanism involves inhibition of COX-1 → decreased prostaglandin E₂ → arachidonic acid shunted to leukotriene pathway → increased leukotrienes → bronchoconstriction (see: [[asthma- drugs#Why no NSAIDs?|Asthma & NSAIDs]]). 
- If anti-inflammatory action is essential (e.g., for arthritis), consider selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib (it's enteral only) & Parecoxib (parenteral only)- Both are often used in palliative setting). These are less likely to provoke bronchospasm.
