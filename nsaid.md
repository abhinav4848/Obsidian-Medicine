# NSAID & Asthma
Whether NSAID can be given in asthma depends on the type of asthma and the patient’s history with NSAIDs.
- NSAIDs (like ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac) can trigger bronchospasm in a subset of asthmatics- this is known as NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD) or aspirin-sensitive asthma.
	- This occurs in roughly 10-20% of adults with asthma, especially those who also have nasal polyps or chronic rhinosinusitis. See [[Samter's triad]]. 
- The mechanism involves inhibition of COX-1 → decreased prostaglandin E₂ → increased leukotrienes → bronchoconstriction.
- If anti-inflammatory action is essential (e.g., for arthritis), consider selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib (it's enteral only)- used often in palliative setting. Parecoxib is parenteral only). These are less likely to provoke bronchospasm.
