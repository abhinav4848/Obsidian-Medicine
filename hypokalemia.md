# Causes
#mnemonic: BBADD VVCCR
- B -> [[Bartter's syndrome]] (in neonates/children, AR),
- B: Beta 2 agonist: Salbutamol.
- A: Alkalosis
- D: Diuretics (Thiazide, Furosemide)
- D: Diarrhea -> loss of HCO3- in stool -> Hypokalemic (Normal anion gap) [[metabolic acidosis]]
- V: Villous adenoma
- V: Vomiting -> loss of HCl -> Hypokalemic Hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis > low K+.
- 2 Cs -> Cushing's (High cortisol), Conn's (High aldosterone)
- R: Renal tubular acidosis

# Clinical Features
FAINTING, Tiredness, Weakness, Leg Cramps,
ECG: [[qT prolongation|long QT syndrome]], Depressed ST segment & T wave, U wave on ECG.
Predisposes to Digoxin toxicity.

# Treatment
The normal serum potassium is 3.5-5 mmol/I
If K+ is < 2.5 Or, < 3 with ECG Changes "U wave"
	-> IV potassium chloride. (e.g. 40 mmol KCI in 1 L Normal Saline IV infusion)

If K+ >= 2.5, without ECG changes
	-> Oral Potassium Supplements.

Remember to order Magnesium and ABG to exclude Metabolic Alkalosis.

**Magnesium** inhibits the ROMK channel in the tubule (I think DCT). Lack of inhibition of this channel causes massive potassium losses in the urine in hypomagnesaemia
