## 1. Big picture: what NICE actually produces
NICE doesn’t make “one type” of guidance. It produces **different products for different jobs**:
- **Clinical practice** (what to do)
- **Funding decisions** (what the NHS must pay for)
- **Quality measurement** (what good care looks like)
- **Public health & prevention**
- **Local commissioning support**

That’s why you keep seeing **NG**, **TA**, **QS**, **Indicators**, etc.

---
## 2. Core NICE products (the ones you must know)
### 🔵 1. NICE Guidelines (**NG**)
**Example:** NG203 – Chronic kidney disease
**What they are**
- Broad **clinical practice guidelines**
- Cover **diagnosis, monitoring, referral, management**
- Evidence-based, consensus-driven

**What they do NOT do well**
- They often **don’t give drug-by-drug eligibility**
- They may say _“consider drug X”_ without thresholds

**Status**
- Advisory but **very influential**
- Courts, CQC, examiners treat them as gold standard

**Use them when**
- Writing management plans
- Answering exams
- Structuring GP care

---
### 🟣 2. NICE Technology Appraisals (**TA**)
**Examples:**
- TA775 – Dapagliflozin for CKD
- TA942 – Empagliflozin for CKD

**What they are**
- **Legal funding decisions**
- Decide whether the NHS **must provide a drug**
- Very specific inclusion/exclusion criteria

**Key point**
> If a drug has a positive TA, the NHS is **legally obliged** to fund it (within criteria)

**Why CKD SGLT2i live here**
- Because they are **new, expensive drugs**
- NG203 refers you _out_ to TAs for details

**Use them when**
- Starting expensive meds
- Challenging an ICB
- Being precise about eligibility

📌 **If NG says “consider” but TA says “recommended” → TA wins for access**

---
### 🟢 3. NICE Quality Standards (**QS**)
**Example:** QS5 – CKD quality standard
**What they are**
- Short statements of **what high-quality care looks like**
- Each QS has:
    - A statement
    - A rationale
    - A measurable outcome

**Example**
> “People with CKD and ACR ≥3 are offered ACE inhibitors.”

**They are NOT**
- Full guidelines
- Not detailed management plans

**Use them when**
- Audits
- QOF-style thinking
- Explaining “standard of care”

---
### 🟠 4. NICE Quality Indicators
**Example:** IND322 – CKD and SGLT2 inhibitors
**What they are**
- **Measurable metrics** derived from QS/TAs
- Used for:
    - Population health
    - Benchmarking
    - Service evaluation

**Important nuance**
- They often **operationalise** TAs
- That’s why they give **clear eGFR + ACR cut-offs**

**Why they matter clinically**
- They reveal what NICE _expects_ to be happening in practice
- They often feel more “practical” than NGs

📌 For CKD + SGLT2i, **IND322 is the clearest NICE document** for non-diabetics.

---
## 3. Other NICE products (know them, don’t memorise)
### 🟡 Public Health Guidelines (**PH**)
Now NG
- Prevention, screening, lifestyle
- e.g. smoking, obesity, physical activity
### ⚫ Interventional Procedures Guidance (**IPG**)
- Safety/efficacy of procedures
- Not about funding
- e.g. new surgical techniques
### 🔴 Medical Technologies Guidance (**MTG**)
- Devices, diagnostics
- e.g. monitoring tech
### 🔵 Diagnostics Guidance (**DG**)
- Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic tests

## 4. One-table summary (bookmark this mentally)

| Type                         | Code | Purpose                                                                                          | Binding?                                                  | Example              |

# How CKS differs from NICE
| Feature                  | NICE Guidance (NG, TA, etc) | NICE CKS                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Level                    | High-level recommendations  | Practical step-by-step care |
| Focus                    | What _should_ be done       | How to _actually do it_     |
| Includes dosing?         | Often no                    | **Yes**                     |
| Includes safety-netting? | Sometimes                   | **Always**                  |
| Primary care-specific    | Mixed                       | **Yes**                     |
| Medicolegal weight       | High                        | Supportive, not binding     |
CKS interprets and operationalises NICE guidance (plus other evidence like SIGN, RCGP, BNF).

## 5. How _you_ should use these in practice (GP lens)
- **Exams / teaching** → **NG**
- **Starting new expensive drugs** → **TA**
- **Audits / QOF / ARRS logic** → **QS + Indicators**
- **“Why is the ICB asking for this?”** → **Indicators**
- **Disputes about funding** → **TA (always wins)**

---
## 6. CKD + SGLT2i example (pulling it together)
- NG203 → says SGLT2i are part of CKD management    
- TA775 / TA942 → legally approve use in **non-diabetic CKD** & say the NHS must fund them
- [IND322](https://www.nice.org.uk/indicators/ind322-kidney-conditions-ckd-and-sglt-2-inhibitors) → tells services **exactly which patients** should be on them
- **CKS CKD** → tells you:
    - when to consider them
    - how to start
    - what to monitor
    - what to warn patients about

CKS is where the **“how”** lives. That’s why **the detail lives outside the NG**.
