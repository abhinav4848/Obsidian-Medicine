# Types:
1. Basement membrane can grow inward into the lactiferous duct -> Ductal carcinoma in situ
	- Can also grow out of the duct -> Invasive ductal carcinoma (aka NST: No special type)
	- Can grow along the lactiferous duct onto skin -> Paget's
2. Tumour grows within lobules -> Lobular carcinoma in situ (all others are called special type).
	- Less common but more likely to invade if occurs: Invasive lobular carcinoma
3. Inflammatory breast cancer -> cancer cells block the lymphatic drainage of the breast looking like an inflamed breast on examination.
