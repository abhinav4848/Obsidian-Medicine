# Approach to classification
Think of breast cancer this way:
1. Where is the tumour relative to the basement membrane?
	1. In situ (non-invasive)- Cancer cells are confined above the basement membrane, Can't metastasize, but can progress to invasive. 
	2. Invasive- Cancer cells have breached the basement membrane & can metastasize
2. Where did it come from?
	1. Lactiferous Ducts (most common)
	2. Lobules
3. Special clinical patterns

| Ductal  | DCIS<br><br>- Often asymptomatic<br>- detected on screening mammography (microcalcifications)<br>- precursor to IDC                                             | IDC<br><br>- aka NST (no special type)<br><br>Most common type                                                                                                                                                | **Paget's**<br><br>Ductal cancer can grow along the lactiferous duct onto nipple epidermis |
| Lobular | LCIS<br><br>- Not a true cancer precursor in the same way as DCIS<br>- Marker of increased bilateral breast cancer risk<br>- Often incidental finding on biopsy | ILC<br><br>- Cells infiltrate in a single-file pattern<br>- Often subtle on exam and imaging<br>- More likely to be Bilateral & Multifocal.<br>- May present as breast thickening rather than a discrete lump |                                                                                            |
### Inflammatory breast cancer
Lymphatic obstruction causing red, swollen, peau d’orange breast
### Phyllodes tumour
Arises from stromal tissue (not epithelium)
Can be Benign, Borderline, Malignant
Rapidly growing, leaf-like mass
