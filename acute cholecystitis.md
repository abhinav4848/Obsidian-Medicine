Inflammation of gall bladder due to obstruction of cystic duct by gallstone. 

Pain similar to biliary colic but more severe and persistent. The pain may radiate to the back or right shoulder. 

**5Fs**: Fat, forty, fair, fertile, female.
# Clinical Features
- The patient may be pyrexial and Murphy's sign #named positive (arrest of inspiration on palpation of the RUQ). 
- Pain usually starts 2-3 hrs after eating. Worse after eating fatty food.
- Pain starts in epigastric region and localises to RUQ. Lasts more than 24 hrs (less in colic)
- Fever (absent in [[biliary colic]]). 

## Lab
ALP & GGT rise first, and as bile continues to back up, AST and ALT will rise. 
Amylase will help identify gallstone pancreatitis. 

# DDx
Everything is same in biliary colic except **Acute cholecystitis has inflammatory component** which Is absent in Biliary colic (i.e. local peritonism, fever, WBC high)

# USG
thick walled shrunken gallbladder.

# Treatment
once symptoms settle -> laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

If the stones move to CBD -> Obstructive jaundice, [[ascending cholangitis]].
Treatment is recommended for bile duct stones regardless of whether they are symptomatic or not.
