Inflammation of gall bladder due to obstruction of cystic duct by gallstone. 

Pain similar to [[biliary colic]] but more severe and persistent. The pain may radiate to the back or right shoulder. 

**5Fs**: Fat, forty, fair, fertile, female. #mnemonic 
# Clinical Features
- The patient may be pyrexial and Murphy's sign #named positive (arrest of inspiration on palpation of the RUQ). 
- Pain usually starts 2-3 hrs after eating. Worse after eating fatty food.
- Pain starts in epigastric region and localises to RUQ. Lasts more than 24 hrs (less in colic)
- Fever (absent in [[biliary colic]]). 

# Investigation
ALP & GGT rise first, and as bile continues to back up, AST and ALT will rise. 
Amylase will help identify gallstone pancreatitis. 
## USG
thick walled shrunken gallbladder.

# Treatment
once symptoms settle -> laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Treatment is recommended for bile duct stones regardless of whether they are symptomatic or not.

# Differences
#confusion 
Acute cholecystitis has inflammatory component which Is absent in Biliary colic (i.e. local peritonism, fever, WBC high). If the stones move to CBD & infection occurs-> Obstructive jaundice, [[ascending cholangitis]].
