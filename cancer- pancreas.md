# Risk Factor
Smoking, DM, Chronic pancreatitis, age, HNPCC, BRCA2, MEN, KRAS
*(alcohol is not an independent risk factor)*

# Clinical Features
- Painless jaundice (there can be epigastric pain radiating to back and worse on lying flat or after eating), 
- Weight loss, 
- anorexia, 
- epigastric pain, 
- back pain, 
- Loss of exocrine function: steatorrhea (pale stool),
- Loss of endocrine function: recent onset DM ([[paraneoplastic syndrome]]),
- Cholestatic LFTs (raised ALP and Î³GT) -> cuz pancreatic head compressed the Bile duct. 
	- cholestatic LFT can also bee seen in [[cancer- cholangiocarcinoma]]. 
- Migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau's sign #named  -> not the hypocalcaemia one. Here, there is multiple venous thrombosis due to procoagulant factors formed by cancer cells.) [[prim]]

>**Courvoisier's law** states that in the presence of painless obstructive jaundice, a palpable gallbladder is unlikely to be due to gallstones.

# Investigation 
- Most initial/most appropriate investigation: HRCT abdomen > if no CT, then USG. If CT normal -> ERCP. 
	- imaging may demonstrate the 'double duct' #named sign - the presence of simultaneous dilatation of the common bile and pancreatic ducts
- CA 19-9: Non-specific but helps assess prognosis. [[tumor marker]]. 

**Gallstones**: If jaundice with epigastric pain, RUQ pain -> USG.

# Treatment
Whipple's resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy) is performed for resectable lesions in the head of pancreas. Side-effects of a Whipple's include dumping syndrome and peptic ulcer disease.

Less than 20% are suitable for surgery at time of diagnosis. 
ERCP for stenting for palliation.
