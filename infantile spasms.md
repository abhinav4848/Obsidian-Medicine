It's a severe epileptic encephalopathy of infancy which typically presents between 3 and 7 months of age.
More common in male infants. 
It is frequently associated with an underlying structural, genetic, or metabolic disorder and carries a generally poor prognosis, particularly when symptomatic.  
# Clinical Features
- characteristic 'salaam' attacks (jackknife seizures): sudden flexion of the head, trunk and arms, sometimes followed by extension #named 
- spasms are brief (1–2 seconds) but occur in clusters, often dozens of episodes over several minutes
- developmental arrest or regression is typical
# Investigation
- EEG classically shows hypsarrhythmia (chaotic, high-amplitude slow waves with multifocal spikes)
- MRI brain is preferred and demonstrates an underlying cause in the majority (e.g. tuberous sclerosis, cortical malformations, hypoxic–ischaemic injury)
# Management  
- overall prognosis is poor, especially in symptomatic cases
- vigabatrin is first-line treatment
    - this is combined with high-dose oral prednisolone for infantile spasms that are not due to tuberous sclerosis
