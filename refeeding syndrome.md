Illness caused by rapid refeeding of a malnourished individual
# Starvation
Low glucose -> High glucagon -> gluconeogenesis -> depletion of phosphate stores. 
# Refeeding
Administer carbs -> high glucose -> increased insulin -> Increased uptake of **KMP** into cells. Severe Hypophosphatemia is first feature. 

Overall loss of **KMP**: loss of K+, Mg2+, P 
They also have loss of thiamine, Vit B12, multivitamins & trace minerals. 
Can have sodium retention and lead to volume overload. 
# Clinical Features 
Cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic.
Tissue hypoxia, Myocardial dysfunction, inability for diaphragm to contract.
Hypophosphatemia, [[Hypokalemia]], CHF, Peripheral edema.
Thiamine deficiency -> if feed carbs, can precipitate wernicke encephalopathy, so give thiamine before providing nutritional support.

# Treatment
When introducing feeds to a malnourished individual, do baseline bloods and give small feed the first day. Also add thiamine and vit B co strong. Repeat bloods the next day and supplement missing nutrients. Continue feed as tolerated. Repeat bloods daily. Avoid giving calcium as it can exacerbate hypophosphatemia. 

Exogenous insulin will _exacerbate_ the electrolyte abnormalities involved in refeeding syndrome (e.g., hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia).
If diuresis necessary, consider a combination of loop diuretic plus amiloride to minimize potassium and magnesium excretion.
