# Starvation  
Low glucose -> High glucagon -> gluconeogenesis -> depletion of phosphate stores. 
# Refeeding
High glucose -> high insulin -> Increased uptake of PO4 into cells.

So, severe Hypophosphatemia.
Overall loss of **KMP**: loss of K+, Mg2+, P 

# Clinical Features: 
Cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic.
Tissue hypoxia, Myocardial dysfunction, inability for diaphragm to contract.
Hypophosphatemia, Hypokalemia, Thiamine deficiency, CHF, Peripheral edema.
