# BPH	
**Alpha-1 blockers**: Tamsulosin, doxazosin, alfuzosin
- **s/e**: Postural hypotension, Drowsiness, Dyspnoea, Cough
- Alpha blockers are given to relax smooth muscles of bladder and prostate for fast relief (BPH can cause acute retention). And also if just LUT features. But it doesn't slow the growth of BPH. 
	        
**5 alpha reductase inhibitor**: Finasteride
- These take up-to 6 months to start acting and are given to those with high risk of progression of BPH. i.e. LUT + Large prostate + raised PSA
- **s/e**: Erectile dysfunction, Ejaculation problems, Gynecomastia
	- Finasteride is not a fun ride when you have erectile dysfunction

Surgery: TURP
- **s/e**: Hyponatremia: Confusion & Agitation.

# PSA test
*[[cancer- screening programs]]*
*[[tumor marker]]*

Not a sensitive test. 
NICE says 'If a hard, irregular prostate typical of a prostate carcinoma is felt on rectal examination, then the patient should be referred urgently. The PSA should be measured and the result should accompany the referral.'

However in an asymptomatic patient where you can't do PSA yet, a digital rectal examination is not a substitute for a PSA test.

Donâ€™t have before test:
	48 hrs.: Ejaculation
	48 hrs.: Exercised vigorously
	1 wk.: Digital rectal exam
	4 wk.: UTI (PSA is always high during & after UTI), Prostatitis
	6 wk.: prostate biopsy
	
Levels:
	40-49: >=2
	50-69: >=3
	Over 70: >=5
	
Do a 2ww referral. *See [[cancer- prostate|Prostate Cancer]].*
