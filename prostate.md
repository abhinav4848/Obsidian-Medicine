# Manage patient coming with urinary symptoms
1. Get bloods done- FBC, U&e, LFT, HbA1c, Bone profile, [[prostate#PSA test|PSA]]
2. get urine dip to rule out infection. Referral for 2ww includes question on whether you tested for UTI. 
3. DRE 
4. Risk factors for [[cancer- prostate|Prostate Cancer]]: Age > 50, [[afro-caribbean|Afro Caribbean]], [[cancer- risk factors|family history]]. 
5. if there's haematuria, then wonder where it could come from- [[cancer- urology|bladder]], kidney, possibly prostate. That's where smoking becomes a risk factor for kidney/bladder cancers. It's not a risk factor towards prostate cancer itself.

# BPH
Patients have storage and voiding symptoms. 
*See [[incontinence- adult]]*. 
###### Alpha-1 blockers
Tamsulosin, doxazosin, alfuzosin
- **s/e**: Postural hypotension, Drowsiness, Dyspnoea, Cough
- Alpha blockers are given to relax smooth muscles of bladder and prostate for fast relief (BPH can cause acute retention). And also if just LUT features. But it doesn't slow the growth of BPH. 
##### Anticholinergics %%(is transcluded)%%
When a patient with BPH exhibits persistent mixed urinary symptoms (storage & voiding) despite monotherapy with an alpha-blocker, can give antimuscarinic agent such as tolterodine/darifenacin/oxybutynin.
##### 5-alpha reductase inhibitor
Finasteride
- These take up-to 6 months to start acting and are given to those with high risk of progression of BPH. i.e. LUT + Large prostate + raised PSA
- **s/e**: Erectile dysfunction, Ejaculation problems, [[gynaecomastia|Gynecomastia]]
	- Finasteride is not a fun ride when you have erectile dysfunction
##### Surgery
TURP
- **s/e**: Hyponatremia: Confusion & Agitation.

# Prostate Cancer
[[cancer- prostate]].

# Prostatitis
Can be post biopsy: E coli is common cause
## Clinical Features
Cloudy urine and foul smell, abdominal pain.
Will be tender on DRE. 
## Treatment
If patient normal: E coli
	**Rx**: Quinolone ([[ciprofloxacin]], ofloxacin) > Co-trimoxazole #abx 
	14 day course of Quinolone for Prostatitis: Cipro, Ofloxacin empirically
	Quinolones penetrate the prostate better than other antibiotics. 
If with calculus
	**Rx**: TURP 
If immunocompromised: Pseudomonas

# PSA test
See: *[[cancer- screening programs]] & [[tumour marker]]*

Not a sensitive test. 
3/4th of raised PSAs can be normal. 

NICE says 'If a hard, irregular prostate typical of a prostate carcinoma is felt on rectal examination, then the patient should be referred urgently. The PSA should be measured and the result should accompany the referral.'

However in an asymptomatic patient where you can't do PSA yet, a digital rectal examination is not a substitute for a PSA test.

Don’t have before test:
	48 hrs.: Ejaculation
	48 hrs.: Exercised vigorously
	1 wk.: Digital rectal exam
	4 wk.: UTI (PSA is always high during & after UTI), Prostatitis
	6 wk.: prostate biopsy
	
PSA levels rise naturally with age, so thresholds: 
	40-49: >=2
	50-69: >=3
	Over 70: >=5
	
Do a 2ww referral. *See [[cancer- prostate|Prostate Cancer]].*
