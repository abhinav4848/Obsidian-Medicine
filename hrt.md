See: [[hrt- negatives|negatives & cautions with HRT]] 

As part of managing [[menopause]]. 
# Hormone choice rationale
- Oestrogen → treats menopausal symptoms. 
- Progestogen → protects the endometrium from oestrogen-induced hyperplasia/[[cancer- endometrial|Endometrial Cancer]]. 
- If uterus present → progestogen is mandatory (unless oestrogen is local only)
	- If they have Mirena (It is IUS LNG), then can give oestrogen via another route. 
	- It's the only IUS licensed for endometrial protection. 

# Methods of HRT
## Sequential (cyclical) HRT 
- Continuous oestrogen. 
- Progestogen added for part of the cycle (usually 10–14 days/month). 
- Mimics a menstrual cycle. Bleeding is expected. 
Used for perimenopausal women with last bleeding <=12 months post-LMP. 
## Continuous combined HRT 
Oestrogen + progestogen every day. 

Used for Postmenopausal women
- >= 12 months since last menstrual period
- >= 2 years post-menopause if <50 years old
# When does woman need contraception?
Needs it: <55y +  sexually active + menstruating
Doesn't need it: 
- ≤50y + amenorrhoeic ≥2y 
- \>50y and has been amenorrhoeic for ≥1y. (*natural menopause not on the progesterone pill*).
# Scenarios
Has uterus & needs contraception.
- Oestrogen-only pill, patch or spray + Mirena (other IUSs not licensed for endometrial protection).
- Combined hormonal contraception (if eligible).
- Sequential combined HRT (pill or patch or spray) + progestogen-only contraception (tablet, implant, injection)- because the dose of progesterone needed for ovulation suppression is a lot more than the dose available in HRT. i.e. HRT doses are not contraceptive. 
- If amenorrhoeic with progestogenic contraception: consider Mirena
	- If Mirena is not suitable, refer to the complex menopause clinic. 
- If hormonal contraception declined: advise barrier methods with sequential combined HRT.

Has uterus, doesn't need contraception, has been amenorrhoeic > 1 year
