As part of managing [[menopause]]. 
# Hormone choice rationale
- Oestrogen → treats menopausal symptoms. 
	- HRT uses Oestradiol (E2) which is normal human oestrogen
	- [[COCP]] uses EE which is a very potent synthetic oestrogen. 
- Progestogen → protects the endometrium from oestrogen-induced hyperplasia/[[cancer- endometrial|Endometrial Cancer]]. 
- If uterus present → progestogen is mandatory (unless oestrogen is local only)
	- If they have Mirena (It is IUS LNG), then can give oestrogen via another route. 
	- It's the only IUS licensed for endometrial protection. 
#### Androgenicity of progesterone 
NET (Most Androgenic) ≈ LNG < GSD ≈ DSG ≈ NGT < DRSP < Cyproterone acetate (Strongly anti-Androgenic)
- **Second generation (LNG, NET)** → more androgenic
- **Third generation (DSG, GSD, NGT)** → less androgenic
- **Drospirenone** → anti-androgenic

# Methods of HRT
## Sequential (cyclical) HRT 
- Continuous oestrogen. 
- Progestogen added for part of the cycle (usually 10–14 days/month). 
- Mimics a menstrual cycle. Bleeding is expected. 
Used for perimenopausal women with last bleeding <=12 months post-LMP. 
## Continuous combined HRT 
Oestrogen + progestogen every day. 

Used for Postmenopausal women
- >= 12 months since last menstrual period
- >= 2 years post-menopause if <50 years old

# When does menopausal/pre-menopausal woman need contraception?
Needs it: <55y +  sexually active + menstruating
Doesn't need it: 
- ≤50y + amenorrhoeic ≥2y 
- \>50y and has been amenorrhoeic for ≥1y. (*natural menopause not on the progesterone pill*).
# Scenarios
1. Needs contraception
	- Oestrogen-only pill, patch or spray + Mirena (other IUSs not licensed for endometrial protection).
	- Combined hormonal contraception (if eligible).
	- Sequential combined HRT (pill or patch or spray) + progestogen-only contraception (tablet, implant, injection)- because the dose of progesterone needed for ovulation suppression is a lot more than the dose available in HRT. i.e. HRT doses are not contraceptive. 
	- If amenorrhoeic with progestogenic contraception: consider [[contraceptives|Mirena]]
		- If Mirena is not suitable, refer to the complex menopause clinic. 
	- If hormonal contraception declined: advise barrier methods with sequential combined HRT.

2. Has uterus, doesn't need contraception, has been amenorrhoeic > 1 year: Offer continuous combined HRT: 
	- Continuous combined pill
	- Continuous combined patch
	- Oestrogen only pill/patch/gel/spray, with
		- IUS
		- Medroxyprogesterone acetate 5mg OD
		- Micronized progesterone 100mg OD

3. Has uterus, doesn't need contraception, not been amenorrhoeic > 1 year: Offer sequential combined HRT:
	- Sequential combined pill
	- Sequential combined patch
	- Oestrogen only pill/patch/gel/spray, with
		- IUS
		- Medroxyprogesterone acetate ==10mg OD==
		- Micronized progesterone ==200mg OD==
