Risk of Down's syndrome with increasing maternal age: 

| Age (years) | Risk               |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 20          | 1 in 1,500         |
| 30          | 1 in 800           |
| 35          | 1 in 270           |
| 40          | 1 in 100           |
| 45          | 1 in 50 or greater |
One way of remembering this is by starting at 1/1,000 at 30 years and then dividing the denominator by 3 (i.e. 3 times more common) for every extra 5 years of age

| **Mode**                                          | **% of cases** | **Risk of recurrence**                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nondisjunction                                    | 94%            | 1 in 100 if under mother < 35 years                                                    |
| Robertsonian translocation  <br>(usually onto 14) | 5%             | 10-15% if mother is translocation carrier  <br>2.5% if father is translocation carrier |
| Mosaicism*                                        | 1%             |                                                                                        |
 
TheÂ chance of a further child with Down's syndrome is approximately 1 in 100 if the mother is less than 35 years old. If the trisomy 21 is a result of a translocation the risk is much higher  

  
*Mosaicism is defined as the presence of two genetically different populations of cells in the body
