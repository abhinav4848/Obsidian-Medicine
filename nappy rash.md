| **Irritant dermatitis**        | The most common cause, due to irritant effect of urinary ammonia and faeces.<br><br>**Skin Creases are spared** as irritant will not come in contact with the skin in the crease.<br><br>barrier cream protects against irritant dermatitis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **_Candida_Â dermatitis**       | Typically an erythematous rash (**Beefy red**, well defined lesion) which involve the flexures and has characteristic satellite papules.<br><br>It can spare the gluteal cleft and inguinal regions. (The gluteal cleft isn't considered a flexural surface. The skin doesn't fold in on itself to form it)<br><br>If suspected candidal nappy rash: topical imidazole, like clotrimazole. #antifungal<br><br>Cease the use of a barrier cream until the candida has settled, otherwise it can make fungal infection worse. |

May be coexistent scalp rash. aka [[cradle cap]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
