# Side effect of steroids
- [[osteoporosis]]: No pain. Directly bone # ([[osteomalacia]] is painful)
- Avascular necrosis of hip
- Cataract
- Peptic ulcers
- Hyperglycemia (impaired glucose regulation)

- [[Mania]], Psychosis
- Insomnia

- Neutrophilia -> initial rise of neutrophils due to de-margination as L-selectin is down regulated. However, this is transient and after a few weeks the levels will begin to drop and return to normal
# Long term steroids- Extra steps for patients on them
More than 3 weeks of usage

#mnemonic Don't stop M
- Don't -> stop suddenly -> risk of adrenal insufficiency/crisis
- [[Sick day rules]] -> increase dose if unwell
- Treatment card/Steroid card 
- [[Osteoporosis]] prevention -> [[Bisphosphonates]], [[calcium]], [[vitamin-d|vit D]] supplements
- Proton pump inhibitor 
- MedicAlert bracelet 

## Notes on topical steroids %%(is transcluded)%%
Using topical steroids in [[plaque psoriasis]].  
- as we know topical corticosteroid therapy may lead to skin atrophy, striae and rebound symptoms 
    - the scalp, face and flexures are particularly prone to steroid atrophy so topical steroids should not be used for more than 1-2 weeks/month 
- systemic side-effects may be seen when potent corticosteroids are used on large areas e.g. > 10% of the body surface area 
- NICE recommend that we aim for a 4-week break before starting another course of topical corticosteroids
- they also recommend using potent corticosteroids for no longer than 8 weeks at a time and very potent corticosteroids for no longer than 4 weeks at a time
