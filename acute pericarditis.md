Inflammation of pericardial sac
lasting for less than 4-6 weeks.  
# Aetiology
- viral infections (Coxsackie)
- [[tuberculosis]]
- uraemia
- post-myocardial infarction
	- early (1-3 days): fibrinous pericarditis
	- late (weeks to months): autoimmune pericarditis (Dressler's syndrome)
- radiotherapy
- connective tissue disease
    - [[systemic lupus erythematosis|SLE]]
    - [[rheumatoid arthritis]]
- hypothyroidism
- malignancy
    - lung cancer
    - breast cancer
- trauma
# Features
- Pleuritic chest pain. Often relieved by sitting forwards
- other symptoms include a non-productive cough, dyspnoea and flu-like symptoms
- pericardial rub

# Investigations 
- #ECG changes
    - the changes in pericarditis are often global/widespread, as opposed to the 'territories' seen in ischaemic events
    - 'saddle-shaped' ST elevation
    - PR depression: most specific ECG marker for pericarditis
- all patients with suspected acute pericarditis should have transthoracic echocardiography
- bloods
    - inflammatory markers
    - troponin: around 30% of patients may have an elevated troponin - Indicating possible myopericarditis

# Management 
- the majority of patients can be managed as outpatients
    - patients who have high-risk features such as fever > 38°C or elevated troponin should be managed as an inpatient
- treat any underlying cause
    - most patients however will have pericarditis secondary to viral infection, meaning no specific treatment is indicated
- strenuous physical activity should be avoided until symptom resolution and normalisation of inflammatory markers
    - athletes should avoid strenuous exercise for at least 3 months until symptoms have resolved and investigations (CRP, ECG, and echocardiography) have normalised
- a combination of NSAIDs and [[colchicine]] is now generally used for first-line for patients with acute idiopathic or viral pericarditis
    - therapy is continued until symptom resolution and normalisation of inflammatory markers (usually 1–2 weeks), followed by a taper of the dose over a further 2–4 weeks
