Inflammation of pericardial sac.
- Constrictive, because thickened pericardium prevents diastolic filling of ventricles. 
lasts for less than 4-6 weeks. 
# Aetiology
- viral infections (Coxsackie) in developed world
- [[tuberculosis]] in developing world 
- uraemia
- post-MI
	- early (1-3 days): fibrinous pericarditis
	- late (2 weeks to months): autoimmune pericarditis (Dressler's syndrome- can also occur after heart surgery like CABG). 
- post radiotherapy
- connective tissue disease
    - [[systemic lupus erythematosis|SLE]] 
    - [[rheumatoid arthritis]]
- hypothyroidism
- malignancy
    - lung cancer
    - breast cancer
- trauma
# Features
- Pleuritic (retrosternal) chest pain, worsens on inspiration, lying flat & relieved by sitting forwards (reduces contact with inflamed pericardium). Patient may have recent cough, or viral illness history.
- Pericardial friction rub on stethoscope- Best heard when patient is sitting up + leaning forward, and expiring.
- other symptoms include a non-productive cough, dyspnoea and flu-like symptoms. 
# Investigations
- all patients with suspected acute pericarditis should have TTE (echo). 
- bloods
    - inflammatory markers
    - troponin: around 30% of patients may have an elevated troponin - Indicating possible myopericarditis  
- #ECG changes
    - Widespread (as opposed to localised in case of MI) ST elevation with concave upwards + PR segment depression- This is due to epicardium involvement. 
    - 'saddle-shaped' ST elevation
    - PR depression: most specific ECG marker for pericarditis

# Management 
- the majority of patients can be managed as outpatients
    - patients who have high-risk features such as fever > 38°C, or elevated troponin should be managed as an inpatient
- treat any underlying cause
    - most patients however will have pericarditis secondary to viral infection, meaning no specific treatment is indicated
- a combination of NSAIDs and [[colchicine]] is now generally used for first-line for patients with acute idiopathic, or viral pericarditis
    - therapy is continued until symptom resolution and normalisation of inflammatory markers (usually 1–2 weeks), followed by a taper of the dose over a further 2–4 weeks
- 2nd line: Steroids
- Restrict strenuous physical activity till symptoms+ inflammatory markers settle
    - athletes should avoid strenuous exercise for at least 3 months until symptoms have resolved and investigations (CRP, ECG, and echocardiography) have normalised
