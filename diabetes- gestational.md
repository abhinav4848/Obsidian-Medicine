# Risk factors for gestational diabetes
- BMI of > 30 kg/m²
- previous macrosomic baby weighing 4.5 kg or above
- previous GDM
- first-degree relative with DM
- family origin with a high prevalence of DM (South Asian, [[afro-caribbean|black Caribbean]] and Middle Eastern)

# Screening for GDM
- OGTT is test of choice
- H/o prev. GDM: OGTT soon after booking & at 24-28 weeks if the first test is normal.
- Early self-monitoring of blood glucose is an alternative to the OGTTs.
	- Targets for self monitoring of pregnant women (pre-existing & GDM)

| Time               | Target      |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Fasting            | 5.3 mmol/l  |
| 2 hour after meals | 6.4 mmol/l  |
| 1 hour after meals | 7.8 mmol/l, |
- Any of the other risk factors should get OGTT at 24-28 weeks.

# Diagnostic thresholds for GDM
GDM is diagnosed if either:
#mnemonic 5-6-7-8

| Fasting     | >= 5.6 mmol/L |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 2 hour OGTT | >= 7.8        |

# Management of pre-existing DM
- weight loss for women with BMI of > 27 kg/m^2
- stop oral hypoglycaemic agents, apart from metformin, and commence insulin
- [[folic acid]] 5 mg/day from pre-conception to 12 weeks gestation
- detailed anomaly scan at 20 weeks including four-chamber view of the heart and outflow tracts
- tight glycaemic control reduces complication rates
- treat retinopathy as can worsen during pregnancy
