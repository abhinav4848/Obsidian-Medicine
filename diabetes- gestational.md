# Risk factors for gestational diabetes
- BMI of > 30 kg/m²
- previous macrosomic baby weighing >= 4.5kg
- previous GDM
- first-degree relative with DM
- family origin with a high prevalence of DM (South Asian, [[afro-caribbean|black Caribbean]] and Middle Eastern)
- Unexplained stillbirth in previous pregnancy. 

# Screening for GDM
- OGTT is test of choice
- H/o prev. GDM: OGTT soon after booking & at 24-28 weeks if the first test is normal.
- Early self-monitoring of blood glucose is an alternative to the OGTTs. 

- Any of the other risk factors should get OGTT at 24-28 weeks.

# Diagnostic thresholds for GDM
GDM is diagnosed if either:
#mnemonic 5-6-7-8
Give 75gm OGTT. 

| Fasting     | >= 5.6 mmol/L |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 2 hour OGTT | >= 7.8        |
These targets are lower than for DM because this is where the risk to fetus meaningfully increases.

# Management of GDM
once a woman has been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, she remains 'high risk for diabetes mellitus' for life and should receive a yearly HbA1c.

# Management of pre-existing DM
- weight loss for women with BMI of > 27 kg/m^2
- stop oral hypoglycaemic agents, apart from metformin, and commence insulin
- [[folic acid]] 5 mg/day from pre-conception to 12 weeks gestation
- detailed anomaly scan at 20 weeks including four-chamber view of the heart and outflow tracts
- tight glycaemic control reduces complication rates
- treat retinopathy as can worsen during pregnancy

# Targets for self monitoring of pregnant women 
For both pre-existing & GDM

| Time               | Target      |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Fasting            | 5.3 mmol/l  |
| 2 hours after meal | 6.4 mmol/l  |
| 1 hour after meal  | 7.8 mmol/l, |

> [!quote]- Why is threshold for diagnosing GDM lower than diagnosing DM?
> Short answer: **because pregnancy changes the risk–benefit maths**.
> ### 1. Pregnancy is a “stress test” for glucose metabolism
> - Placental hormones (hPL, progesterone, cortisol, growth hormone) → **physiological insulin resistance**
> - Even **mild hyperglycaemia** can exceed what the placenta–fetus unit can safely buffer
> 
> So glucose levels that would be “acceptable” outside pregnancy can be **pathological in pregnancy**.
> 
> ---
> ### 2. Fetal risk rises _continuously_ — not at diabetic cut-offs
> Key concept (from **HAPO study**):
> - There is **no clear glucose threshold** where risk suddenly appears
> - Risks (macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycaemia, C-section) **increase progressively** with maternal glucose
> 
> 👉 Therefore, diagnostic cut-offs for GDM are set **where fetal risk meaningfully increases**, not where maternal diabetes complications start.
> 
> ---
> ### 3. Fetus is exposed to maternal glucose all the time
> - Glucose crosses placenta freely
> - Insulin does **not** cross placenta
> - Fetal pancreas responds → **hyperinsulinaemia**
> 
> Even small maternal glucose rises →  
> ➡️ ↑ fetal insulin →  
> ➡️ ↑ fat deposition, organomegaly, post-birth hypoglycaemia
> 
> ---
> ### 4. Maternal benefit of early diagnosis is high, harm is low
> - Treatment = diet, exercise ± metformin/insulin
> - Low risk interventions
> - Big payoff: ↓ macrosomia, ↓ operative delivery, ↓ neonatal morbidity
> 
> So we accept **higher sensitivity** (lower threshold) in pregnancy.

> ### 5. Different purpose of thresholds
> 
> |Condition|Threshold designed to predict|
> |---|---|
> |**Diabetes mellitus**|Maternal microvascular & macrovascular complications|
> |**Gestational diabetes**|Fetal & perinatal complications|
> Hence **different cut-offs**.

> ### One-liner you can use in exams / teaching
> _“GDM thresholds are lower because even mild hyperglycaemia in pregnancy increases fetal risk, whereas DM thresholds are based on maternal complications.”_
