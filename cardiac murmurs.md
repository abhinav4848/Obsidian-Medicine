#Mnemonic: RILE
Right-sided murmur → heard best on Inspiration
Left-sided murmur → heard best on Expiration

Standing & Valsalva increases murmurs of MVP & HOCM.
Squatting & Passive leg raise reduce murmurs of MVP & HOCM.

| **Holosystolic (pansystolic)**     | MR/TR (high-pitched and 'blowing' in character)<br>- TR becomes louder during inspiration, unlike MR<br>- during inspiration, the venous blood flow into the right atrium and ventricle are increased → increases the stroke volume of the right ventricle during systole<br><br>VSD ('harsh' in character) |
| **Late systolic**                  | MVP, [[coarctation of aorta]] (best heard on the back)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
