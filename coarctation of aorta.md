Narrowing of the descending aorta. 

# Associations 
- Turner's syndrome
- bicuspid aortic valve
- berry aneurysms
- neurofibromatosis
# Types
### Infantile form 
- Associated with [[turner's syndrome]].
- Heart failure
### Adult Form
- No mixing of blood like it was in infantile form
- Coarctation after the left subclavian artery (i.e. after all upper branches have left).
- Upstream changes: Increased pressure in head and upper extremities
	- Head: Berry aneurysm
	- Aorta & Aortic valve dilate. Risk of dissection
- Downstream changes: Reduced pressure in lower extremities
	- Weak pulse
	- Claudication
	- Reduced renal perfusion: Increased RAAS activation -> retain salt & water -> [[hypertension]].
- Rib notching due to some intercostal arteries which branch above the coarctation having more pressure in them than the anastomosing intercostal arteries which branched below the coarctation. Blood flow is thus reversed in the arteries which branched below the coarctation. 
# Clinical Features
- Upper limb hypertension with weak or absent femoral pulses (radio-femoral delay). 
- More common in males and often remains undetected until adolescence or early adulthood if the narrowing is not severe enough to cause symptoms in infancy.
- There can be a significant difference in blood pressure between the left and right arms.
- Mid-systolic [[cardiac murmurs|murmur]] max over the back
