# Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
Due to excess dopamine antagonists -> Haloperidol, Metoclopramide, or potent antipsychotics -> Clozapine. 
### Clinical Features
Fever, Muscle rigidity/twitching, sweat, neck stiffness
TRP- tachycardia, rigidity, pyrexia, altered consciousness. 
Onset: Hours to Days 

### Investigation
Raised Creatine kinase -> AKI (due to rhabdomyolysis). 
raised white cell count, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity.

### Rx: 
Stop offending drug
Rapid cooling 
Give dantrolene (post synaptic muscle relaxant) -> Hepatotoxic, 
Dopaminergic agent (Bromocriptine).

# Serotonin syndrome
Due to excess SSRI -> Fluoxetine, Sertraline, [[citalopram]]

**Onset**: Hours

Faster onset,
Faster reflexes,
Dilated pupils
Clonus

# Malignant Hyperthermia
Fever, muscle rigidity, sweating 
Cause: Halothane, succinylcholine

Onset: Minutes to hours 
Has a genetic component
