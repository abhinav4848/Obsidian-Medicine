# Drug-induced hepatitis
Co-amoxiclav (Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) can cause hepatitis especially in people with deteriorated liver functions such as in chronic alcoholics

Clavulanic acid is highly toxic to liver. If the patient already has risk factors for hepatic impairment such as Chronic alcoholism, hepatic excretion of clavulanic acid will be impaired, leading to cholestasis (Jaundice and Dark Urine) "high bilirubin" and drug-induced hepatitis (incredibly high ALT, AST, ALP).

## Drugs that can cause hepatic cholestasis:
Co-Amoxiclav, Flucloxacillin, Steroids, Sulfonylureas, [[Nitrofurantoin]], Fusidic acid, Chlorpromazine, Prochlorperazine, [[tuberculosis|Isoniazid]]
