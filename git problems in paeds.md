# Gastrochisis & Examphalos
Gastroschisis and exomphalos are both examples of congenital visceral malformations.

| Gastroschisis describes a congenital defect in the anterior abdominal wall just lateral to the umbilical cord. Exposed intestine. | In exomphalos (aka omphalocoele) the abdominal contents protrude through the anterior abdominal wall but are covered in an amniotic sac formed by amniotic membrane and peritoneum. |

# Intussusception
Red currant jelly stool (late sign. Currant jelly sputum seen in klebsiella #confusion ), vomiting (initially nonbilious),
## O/E
Sausage-shaped mass in the right hypochondrium and emptiness in the right lower quadrant (Dance's sign) #named 
## Investigation
Target/Doughnut sign on USG.
## Treatment
Air enema insufflation, barium enema, laparotomy

# Jaundice
Physiological jaundice: Jaundice which develops in first 2-3 days and lasts till 14 days.

Pathological jaundice: Jaundice that develops in the first 24 hours.
	First step: measure & record serum bilirubin urgently.

## Prolonged (>14 days, or >21 days if premature)
**Unconjugated (stool yellow, urine no change)**
- Baby well: Breast Milk (lasts up to 12 weeks)
- Baby unwell: Galactosemia
	- suspect when term infant gets E. coli sepsis,
	- neonate develops cataract.
	- There's poor feed, hepatomegaly, vomiting.
	- In galactosemia, urine is pale (straw coloured) and stool is yellow. Cuz more bilirubin is unconjugated than conjugated)

**Conjugated**
- Biliary atresia (stool pale, urine dark)

**Others** (Ignore)
- Viral infections, G6PD, Spherocytosis, ABO incompatibility
- Gilbert: Immature UGT. Unconjugated. Benign.
- Cigler: Absent UGT. Unconjugated
- Dubin: Conjugated. Problem with excretion from hepatocytes to bile duct
- Rotor: Mild form of Dubin
- Hypothyroidism: Protruded tongue, etc. There's impaired bilirubin conjugation, slow gut motility, impaired feeding.****

# Necrotizing Enterocolitis
Mainly prematurity. Formula fed. Also if empirical antibiotics given to infants > 5 days.
## Clinical Features
Blood in stools, abdo distension, increased abdo girth, poor feeding.
## X-Ray
- Distended/dilated bowel loops, often asymmetrical
- Pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas): Air in bowel wall.
- Portal venous gas
- pneumoperitoneum resulting from perforation
- air both inside and outside of the bowel wall (Rigler sign)
- air outlining the falciform ligament (football sign)

## Treatment
give IV fluids, systemic antibiotics

# Hirschprung disease
