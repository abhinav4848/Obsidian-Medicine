# Parametric tests
Normally distributed. 
- Pearson's product-moment coefficient is a parametric test assessing correlation. The type of significance test used depends on whether the data is parametric (something which can be measured, usually normally distributed) or non-parametric.
- Student's unpaired t-test is used for parametric data. T-tests = comparing averages  
- Student's paired t-test is used for parametric data, and data needs to be paired. 

Paired data refers to data obtained from a single group of patients, such as before and after an intervention. 
Unpaired data comes from two different groups of patients, such as those given the vaccine and those given the placebo in a study. 

# Non-Parametric tests
- Mann–Whitney U test = comparing ranked scores. This is for non-parametric data and compares ordinal, interval, or ratio scales of unpaired data. 
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test: compares two sets of observations on a single sample, e.g. a 'before' and 'after' test on the same population following an intervention. 
- chi-squared test: used to compare proportions or percentages e.g. compares the percentage of patients who improved following two different interventions
- Spearman, Kendall rank - correlation (Correlation = seeing if two numbers move together)
