Vit D helps absorb [[calcium]] from the gut. 
# Who needs supplementation?
Group of people with higher risk of vitamin D deficiency: 
- all pregnant and breastfeeding women should take a daily supplement containing 10µg of vitamin D
- all children aged 6 months - 5 years. Babies fed with formula milk do not need to take a supplement if they are taking more than 500ml of milk a day, as formula milk is fortified with vitamin D
- adults > 65 years
- 'people who are not exposed to much sun should also take a daily supplement' e.g. housebound patients
# Testing
Not many people warrant a vitamin D test. Testing may be appropriate in the following situations: 
- patients with bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment e.g. known osteomalacia or [[Paget's disease of bone]]
- patients with bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin deficiency is appropriate e.g. prior to intravenous Zolendronate or denosumab 
	- Zoledronate (a [[bisphosphonates|bisphosphonate]]) and denosumab both suppress osteoclast activity. If calcium intake/absorption is already low due to vitamin D deficiency, serum calcium can drop dangerously once bone resorption is blocked. 
- patients with musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency e.g. bone pain ?[[osteomalacia]]

Patients with [[osteoporosis]] should always be given calcium/vitamin D supplements so testing is not considered necessary. People who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency should be treated anyway so again testing is not necessary.
