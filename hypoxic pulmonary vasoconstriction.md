# Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV)
HPV is the physiological constriction of small pulmonary arteries in response to low oxygen levels (alveolar hypoxia). It’s a unique mechanism in the lungs- most other vascular beds dilate in response to hypoxia, but the pulmonary circulation constricts.
## Purpose / Physiological Role
- The main goal is ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) matching.
- If a region of the lung is poorly ventilated (low oxygen in alveoli):
    - The small arteries in that region constrict.
    - Blood is diverted to better-ventilated regions of the lung.
- This optimizes oxygen uptake and prevents systemic hypoxemia.
## Mechanism
1. Alveolar hypoxia detected → smooth muscle in pulmonary arterioles contracts.
2. Mediators involved:
    - Low oxygen inhibits potassium channels in pulmonary artery smooth muscle → depolarisation → calcium influx → contraction. 
    - Local factors like endothelin-1 (vasoconstrictor) and reduced nitric oxide (vasodilator) play roles.
3. Chronic hypoxia → sustained vasoconstriction → pulmonary hypertension.
## Pathological Consequences
- Acute HPV is protective (improves oxygenation). 
- Chronic HPV, as seen in [[COPD]], [[interstitial lung disease vs pneumonitis|interstitial lung disease]], or high altitude:
	- Leads to pulmonary hypertension.
	- Increases right ventricular afterload → RV hypertrophy → [[cor pulmonale]].
## Clinical Significance
- In COPD: chronic alveolar hypoxia triggers HPV throughout the lungs → persistent pulmonary hypertension → major contributor to cor pulmonale.
-  can reverse or reduce HPV, lowering pulmonary artery pressure and protecting the right heart.
- [[long term oxygen therapy|Oxygen therapy]] can reverse or reduce HPV, lowering pulmonary artery pressure and protecting the right heart.
