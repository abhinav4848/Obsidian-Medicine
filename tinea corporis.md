"Tinea" refers to a skin infection with a dermatophyte (ringworm) fungus.

*Trichophyton rubrum* is a dermatophyte fungus that causes: 
- ringworm (tinea corporis), 
- jock itch (tinea cruris), 
- athlete's foot (tinea pedis). 
# Clinical Features
Red, circular. Ringworm.

It's a fungal infection that can cause red or silver ring-shaped rashes. The rash of tinea corporis is typically itchy and inflamed with a clear centre, which distinguishes it from [[pityriasis versicolor]]. Furthermore, tinea corporis usually presents as isolated lesions rather than multiple ones.

# Treatment
- Clotrimazole cream.
- Oral fluconazole, 
- Oral itraconazole (higher risk of hepatotoxicity than fluco or terbena)
- Oral terbenafine.

Fusidic acid is antibacterial so not suitable here.
Oral [[ketoconazole]] is banned in UK.
