Non-infectious [[granulomatous disease]] involving abnormal collections of inflammatory cells that form lumps known as granuloma in different organs.
# Clinical Features
- Constitutional symptoms
	- Fever, weight loss, night sweat, appetite change, sleep change, pain, fatigue, malaise
- Pulmonary
	- Dry cough, dyspnea, basal rales on auscultation, pulmonary fibrosis
- Extrapulmonary (*Skin & eyes MC. But also heart, renal*)
	- [[Erythema nodosum]], 
	- [[Uveitis]]
	- **Lupus Pernio**: A pathognomonic manifestation of sarcoidosis characterized by extensive indurated purple nodular lesions (i.e., epithelioid granulomas of the dermis) on the nose, cheeks, chin, and/or ears.
	- ![[lupus pernio (classic in sarcoidosis).png]]
	- Butterfly rash as seen in systemic lupus erythematosus.
	- Polyarthralgia

# Types & features
*Classical sarcoidosis is Lofgren syndrome.*

- **Lofgren**: *Love Heals* #mnemonic : b/l Hilar LNE, [[Erythema nodosum|EN]], (migratory poly-)arthralgia, Lofgren, Sarcoidosis, fever
- **Mikulicz**: (*licks* #mnemonic ) Symmetrical Parotid & Lacrimal gland enlargement (narrowing of palpebral fissures), Dry mouth, Face swelling. (Due to sarcoidosis, TB, Lymphoma)
- **Heerfordt** (uveo-parotid fever): Parotitis, Uveitis (due to sarcoid), Facial palsy

[[Sjogren's syndrome]] on the other hand will always have something related to dry eyes, dry mouth. #confusion 
# Investigation
- CXR: b/l Hilar LNE, 
- Biopsy: Non-caseating granulomas, 
- ACE elevated
- LFT abnormal, 
- Pulmonary function test: Restrictive, 
- [[Hypercalcemia]] (due to elevated Vit D)
- Urea & Electrolytes for Acute Kidney injury due to Hypercalcemia.
- Cardiac sarcoidosis can lead to sudden cardiac death. Perform an ECG in all patients with suspected sarcoidosis regardless of symptoms.
# Treatment
Steroids #steroids 
Spontaneous remission w/o complications is common in early-stage pulmonary disease.
