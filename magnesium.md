# Uses
### Torsades de Pointes
IV magnesium stabilises cardiac myocytes and reduces early after-depolarisations.
### Digitalis toxicity related arrhythmias
Helps control ventricular arrhythmias
### Eclampsia
Given in [[pre-eclampsia#Eclampsia|eclampsia]] as it reduces neuromuscular excitability. 
(NMDA receptor blockade + vasodilation → reduced cerebral irritation.)
### Asthma
[[asthma- acute attack]] 
### Hypokalemia
Potassium won't correct till Mg is normal. 

Magnesium inhibits the ROMK channel in the tubule (I think DCT). Lack of inhibition of this channel causes massive potassium losses in the urine in hypomagnesaemia. So in [[hypokalemia]], check magnesium levels. 
### Constipation & Antacid
Mg(OH)2 acts as laxative
Also used as antacid (see [[dyspepsia]]).

Calcium gluconate is antidote for MgSO4. 

# Renal failure
