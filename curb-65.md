NICE also mention point-of-care CRP test. This is currently not widely available but they make the following recommendation with reference to the use of antibiotic therapy:  
- CRP < 20 mg/L - do not routinely offer antibiotic therapy
- CRP 20 - 100 mg/L - consider a delayed antibiotic prescription
- CRP > 100 mg/L - offer antibiotic therapy
