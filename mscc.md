- sensory changes: sensory loss and numbness
- neurological signs depend on the level of the lesion. Lesions above L1 usually result in UMN signs in the legs and a sensory level. 
- Lesions below L1 usually cause LMN signs in the legs and perianal numbness. Tendon reflexes tend to be increased below the level of the lesion and absent at the level of the lesion
