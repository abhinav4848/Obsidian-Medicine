Oncological emergency. 
# Causes
Osteoarthritis. 
Mostly extradural compression due to [[cancers metastasizing to the bone|vertebral body mets]].  

# Clinical Features 
- back pain
    - the earliest and most common symptom by up-to 7 weeks
    - may be worse on lying down, coughing, sneezing, straining
    - can be in the thoracic or cervical spine. 
- lower limb weakness
- sensory changes: sensory loss and numbness
- Spinal cord ends at L1 or L2 in adults.
	- neurological signs depend on the level of the lesion. Lesions above L1 usually result in UMN signs in the legs and a sensory level. 
	- Lesions below L1 usually cause LMN signs ([[cauda equina syndrome]]) in the legs and perianal numbness. Tendon reflexes tend to be increased below the level of the lesion and absent at the level of the lesion
- If damage is above is above T6 vertebra, neurogenic shock can occur- The sympathetic nervous system is disturbed which leads to loss of tone in blood vessels and peripheries leading to drop in BP. 
- MSCC can be the initial presentation of a cancer and so an important differential to consider when seeing all patients even if no previous history of cancer is known.

# Investigation
Urgent MRI: the 2019 NICE guidelines recommend a **whole MRI spine** within 24 hours of presentation

# Management 
- high-dose oral dexamethasone 16mg until MRI done. 
- urgent oncological assessment for consideration of radiotherapy or surgery
