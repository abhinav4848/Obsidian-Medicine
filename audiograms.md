# Rules of interpretation
- anything above the 20dB line is essentially normal (marked in green on the audiogram below)
- SNHL: both air and bone conduction are impaired
- CHL: only air conduction is impaired. So Air-Bone gap will be seen.
- in mixed HL: both air and bone conduction are impaired, with air conduction often being 'worse' than bone by >=10dB
