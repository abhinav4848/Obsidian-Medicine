Toxicity can be caused by DAMN (not to be confused with DAMN in [[diarrhoea|diarrhoea]]) #mnemonic #confusion 
- Diuretics (Thiazides), 
- [[ace inhibitors|ACE inhibitor]]/ARB, 
- [[Metronidazole]], 
- NSAIDs -> Reduces eGFR.

Lithium can cause [[congenital cyanotic diseases of heart|Ebstein's anomaly]] in fetus #associated 

# Clinical Features of toxicity
Confusion, ataxia, tremor, seizure, polyuria.
Muscle twitch, blurred vision, [[diarrhoea]], vomiting.

# Monitor
Lithium level, TFT, U&E
- TFT, U&E prior to treatment
- Lithium levels weekly until stabilized then every 3 months
- TFT, U&E every 6 months

# Management of Toxicity
- mild-moderate toxicity may respond to volume resuscitation with normal saline
- haemodialysisÂ may be needed in severe toxicity
- sodium bicarbonate -> By increasing the alkalinity of the urine it promotes lithium excretion.
