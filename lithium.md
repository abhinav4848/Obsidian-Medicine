It's a mood stabiliser used in [[bipolar disorder]]. 

Lithium can cause [[congenital cyanotic diseases of heart|Ebstein's anomaly]] in [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|fetus]] #associated

# Monitoring
Lithium level, TFT, U&E
- TFT, U&E prior to treatment
- Lithium levels weekly until stabilized then every 3 months
- TFT, U&E every 6 months

TFT is monitored because Lithium inhibits iodine uptake & Thyroid hormone release, leading to [[hypothyroidism]]. Hypothyroidism can worsen depressive symptoms, or complicate bipolar management.

# Toxicity
Toxicity can be caused by DAMN (not to be confused with DAMN in [[diarrhoea|diarrhoea]])
#mnemonic #confusion 
- Diuretics (Thiazides), 
- [[ace inhibitors|ACE inhibitor]]/ARB, 
- [[Metronidazole]]- it reduces excretion of Lithium, 
- [[nsaid|NSAIDs]] -> Reduces eGFR. 
## Clinical Features of toxicity
Confusion, ataxia, tremor, seizure, polyuria.
Muscle twitch, blurred vision, [[diarrhoea]], vomiting.
## Management of Toxicity
- mild-moderate toxicity may respond to volume resuscitation with normal saline
- haemodialysis may be needed in severe toxicity
- sodium bicarbonate -> By increasing the alkalinity of the urine it promotes lithium excretion.
