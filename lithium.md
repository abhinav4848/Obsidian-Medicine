It's a mood stabiliser used in [[bipolar disorder]]. 

Lithium can cause [[congenital cyanotic diseases of heart|Ebstein's anomaly]] in [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|fetus]] #associated

# Monitoring
Lithium level, TFT, U&E (excreted by Kidneys).
Bloods taken 12 hours post dose. 
- TFT, U&E prior to treatment
- Following change of dose, Lithium levels checked weekly until stabilized, then every 3 months
- TFT, U&E, Calcium, Body weight every 6 months
	- *hypothyroidism, nephrogenic DI, weight gain are s/e.*

TFT is monitored because Lithium inhibits iodine uptake & Thyroid hormone release, leading to [[hypothyroidism]]. Hypothyroidism can worsen depressive symptoms, or complicate bipolar management.

# Toxicity
Therapeutic range (0.4-1.0 mmol/L)
Toxicity can be caused by DAMN (not to be confused with DAMN in [[diarrhoea|diarrhoea]])
#mnemonic #confusion 
- Diuretics (Thiazides), 
- [[ace inhibitors|ACE inhibitor]]/ARB, 
- [[Metronidazole]]- it reduces excretion of Lithium, 
- [[nsaid|NSAIDs]] -> Reduces eGFR. 
## Clinical Features of toxicity
Confusion, ataxia, tremor, [[seizure]], nephrotoxicity (polyuria due to nephrogenic [[diabetes insipidus]]). 
Muscle twitch, blurred vision, [[diarrhoea]], vomiting.
Weight gain, idiopathic intracranial Hypertension
[[hyperparathyroidism]] & hence [[hypercalcemia]]. 
[[hypothyroidism]]. 
## Management of Toxicity
- mild-moderate toxicity may respond to volume resuscitation with normal saline
- haemodialysis may be needed in severe toxicity
- sodium bicarbonate -> By increasing the alkalinity of the urine it promotes lithium excretion.
