Cyst in the popliteal fossa, due to disease of knee joint: OA/RA.
No treatment needed if asymptomatic as can resolve spontaneously.

Foucher's #sign: Cyst feels tense in full knee extension & softens again when knee is flexed.

May rupture and have acute presentation: pain, swelling of calf that mimics DVT.
