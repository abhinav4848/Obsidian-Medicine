- [[spirometry|FEV1]] <30% of predicted. i.e. Very severe airflow obstruction
- SpO2 < 92% on room air
- Cyanosis
- Polycythemia
- Peripheral edema
- Raised JVP
## Conditions for assessment
- Patient should be stable > 5 weeks since last [[COPD]] exacerbation
- Therapy for COPD is fully optimized
- 2 sets ABG 3 weeks apart show him hypoxic

## Offer LTOT 
pO2 < 7.3 kPa
pO2 of 7.3 - 8 kPa & any of:
- Secondary polycythemia
- Peripheral edema
- Pulmonary HTN

If already on LTOT but still breathless -> Prednisolone/nebulized NS to loosen secretions. Can also give carbocsteine for secretions although excess drug can cause excessive loose secretions. LVR (lung volume recruitment) bags help get enough air in to generate a cough.
