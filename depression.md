# Typical Antidepressants
## TCA
Amitriptyline
- 3 C of s/e: Cardiotoxic, convulsions, coma. Has antimuscarinic [[tricyclic antidepressants|side effects]]
- Less commonly used because of risk of toxicity on overdose.
## SSRI
Sertraline, Fluoxetine (both s/e: Anorgasmia/delayed ejaculation, SIADH),
	- Takes 1-2 week (even 2-4 weeks) for effect to be seen
	- Give for 6-9 months.
	- Fluoxetine doesn’t require gradual dose reduction
	- Fluoxetine not given for [panic attacks](onenote:#Psych&section-id={210C3954-BE8B-A24C-8E7F-F1B991349700}&page-id={50279C6F-F501-4FDA-8DF5-A29A9661E516}&object-id={812A8590-5C5D-4878-B3BE-03276416A56F}&99&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/450c0e1b0b9c7922/Documents/Onenote/MBBS/PLAB%201%20+%20MSRA.one). Give sertraline if at all

[[citalopram]] (s/e Acute angle closure glaucoma, [[qT prolongation]]),
Paroxetine
Overall s/e: risk of GI bleed with SSRIs. So avoid them if Warfarin used. If NSAID used, add PPI too. Avoid with Aspirin, Triptans as well).
All SSRIs lower seizure threshold and cause hyponatremia

## MAOi
They are also antidepressants that are almost entirely not used, even in comparison to TCAs (dosulepin, etc.)

# Atypical Antidepressants
1. SNRI: Venlafaxine, Duloxetine
2. Presynaptic alpha 2 antagonist: Mirtazapine (Atypical Antidepressant)
3. **Others**: Trazodone, Bupropion (Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and [[smoking|nicotinic]] acetylcholine antagonist. Bupropion increases seizure risk).

|Post-partum depression|Sertraline (best for breastfeeding mothers)|
|Postpartum Psychosis|ECT|
|Pregnant|- BNF says to weigh up benefits and risk when deciding whether to use in pregnancy.<br>- Use during the T1 gives a small increased risk of congenital heart defects<br>- Use during T3 can result in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn<br>- Paroxetine has an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly in the first trimester|
|Psychotic Depression|TCA|
|Under 18|Fluoxetine only|

## Other notes about treatment

If SSRI not working,

- See compliance -> Switch to another SSRI -> switch to another class: Mirtazapine

Severe Depression: when suicidal/harm self or others: Admit to psych ward. ECT is last to last resort.

Follow up

Following the initiation of antidepressant therapy patients should normally be reviewed by a doctor after 2 weeks.

Patients < 25yo or at increased risk of suicide should be reviewed after 1 week.

Discontinuation

Antidepressants are not addictive and should be used for 6 months at least, even if early improvement seen, as this reduces relapse.  
 

When stopping a SSRI the dose should be gradually reduced over a 4 week period (this is not necessary with fluoxetine). Paroxetine has a higher incidence of discontinuation symptoms.

- Dizziness,
- Paresthesia- Electric shock sensation
- Anxiety
- GI symptoms: pain, cramp, diarrhoea, **vomiting**
