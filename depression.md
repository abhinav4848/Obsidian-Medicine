# Typical Antidepressants
## TCA
Amitriptyline
- 3 C of s/e: Cardiotoxic, convulsions, coma. Has antimuscarinic [[tricyclic antidepressants|side effects]]
- Less commonly used because of risk of toxicity on overdose.
## SSRI
Sertraline, Fluoxetine (both s/e: Anorgasmia/delayed ejaculation, SIADH),
	- Takes 1-2 week (even 2-4 weeks) for effect to be seen
	- Give for 6-9 months.
	- Fluoxetine doesn’t require gradual dose reduction
	- Fluoxetine not given for [[panic attacks]]. Give sertraline if at all

[[citalopram]] (s/e Acute angle closure glaucoma, [[qt prolongation]]),
Paroxetine
Overall s/e: risk of GI bleed with SSRIs. So avoid them if Warfarin used. If NSAID used, add PPI too. Avoid with Aspirin, Triptans as well).
All SSRIs lower seizure threshold and cause hyponatremia

## MAOi
They are also antidepressants that are almost entirely not used, even in comparison to TCAs (dosulepin, etc.)

# Atypical Antidepressants
1. SNRI: Venlafaxine, Duloxetine
2. Presynaptic alpha 2 antagonist: Mirtazapine (Atypical Antidepressant)
3. **Others**: Trazodone, Bupropion (Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and [[smoking|nicotinic]] acetylcholine antagonist. Bupropion increases seizure risk).

# Other notes about treatment
If SSRI not working,
- See compliance -> Switch to another SSRI -> switch to another class: Mirtazapine

Severe Depression: when suicidal/harm self or others: Admit to psych ward. ECT is last to last resort.
# Follow up
Following the initiation of antidepressant therapy patients should normally be reviewed by a doctor after 2 weeks.

Patients < 25yo or at increased risk of suicide should be reviewed after 1 week.
# Discontinuation
Antidepressants are not addictive and should be used for 6 months at least, even if early improvement seen, as this reduces relapse.  

When stopping a SSRI the dose should be gradually reduced over a 4 week period (this is not necessary with fluoxetine). Paroxetine has a higher incidence of discontinuation symptoms.
- Dizziness,
- Paresthesia- Electric shock sensation
- Anxiety
- GI symptoms: pain, cramp, diarrhoea, **vomiting**
