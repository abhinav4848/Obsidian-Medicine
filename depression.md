# Typical Antidepressants
## [[Tricyclic antidepressants]]
Amitriptyline
- 3 C of s/e: Cardiotoxic, convulsions, coma. Has [[anticholinergics|AntiMuscarinic]] [[tricyclic antidepressants|side effects]]
- Less commonly used because of risk of toxicity on overdose.
## SSRI 
Sertraline, Fluoxetine (both s/e: Anorgasmia/delayed ejaculation, SIADH),
	- Takes 1-2 week (even 2-4 weeks) for effect to be seen
	- Give for 6-9 months. 
	- Fluoxetine doesn’t require gradual dose reduction
	- Fluoxetine not given for [[panic attacks]]. Give sertraline if at all. 

[[Citalopram]] (s/e [[glaucoma- acute angle closure|Acute angle closure glaucoma]], [[qt prolongation]]),
Paroxetine.
#### Side Effects of SSRIs 
For all antidepressants, warn about: 
- delay in onset of effect
- transient increase in anxiety/depression, 
- risk of withdrawal if stopped abruptly
	- especially with paroxetine (SSRI) and venlafaxine (SNRI)
	- Taper gradually over an extended period of time. 
	- Withdrawal symptoms: Dizziness, numbness and tingling, gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly nausea and vomiting), headache, sweating, anxiety and sleep disturbances
- Risk of GI bleed with SSRIs. So avoid them if Warfarin used. 
	- If NSAID, Aspirin used, add PPI too. ([BNF Interactions](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/interactions/sertraline/))
	- Avoid Triptans as [[fever caused by drugs|Serotonin syndrome]]. 
- All SSRIs lower seizure threshold and cause [[hyponatremia]]. 
- Be aware when prescribing SSRIs of the need to ask about cocaine use when considering drug–drug interactions, and the need to avoid concurrent use of multiple serotonergic drugs. 
## MAOi 
They are also antidepressants that are almost entirely not used, even in comparison to TCAs (dosulepin, etc.)

# Atypical Antidepressants
1. SNRI: Venlafaxine, Duloxetine
2. Atypical tetracyclic antidepressant: Mirtazapine
	1. NaSSA: Noradrenergic & specific serotonergic antidepressant
3. Trazodone 
4. Bupropion, and [[smoking|nicotinic]] acetylcholine antagonist. 
	1. NDRI: NA and DA reuptake inhibitor
	2. Bupropion increases seizure risk. 
## SNRI
Use 2nd line in [[panic attacks|Generalised Anxiety Disorder]] & panic disorder. 
S/e: 
- The risk of suicide and likelihood of toxicity in overdose (especially with venlafaxine)
- Higher tendency to have withdrawal syndrome. 
# Other notes about treatment
If SSRI not working,
- See compliance -> Switch to another SSRI -> switch to another class: Mirtazapine

Severe Depression: 
- when suicidal/harm self or others
- Admit to psych ward. ECT is last to last resort.
# Follow up
Following the initiation of antidepressant therapy patients should normally be reviewed by a doctor after 2 weeks. 

>[!warning]
Patients < 25yo, or at increased risk of suicide should be reviewed after 1 week. Ensure a risk management strategy is in place. Arrange subsequent reviews as needed and within 4 weeks of starting antidepressant treatment. 
# Discontinuation
Antidepressants are not addictive and should be used for 6 months at least, even if early improvement seen, as this reduces relapse.  

When stopping a SSRI the dose should be gradually reduced over a 4 week period (this is not necessary with fluoxetine). Paroxetine has a higher incidence of discontinuation symptoms.
- Dizziness,
- Paresthesia- Electric shock sensation
- Anxiety
- GI symptoms: pain, cramp, diarrhoea, **vomiting**
