AAA is a dilation of aorta > 3cm diameter. 
# Screening
In UK, routine USG is [[cancer- screening programs|offered]] to men after 65th birthday.
- Between 3 & 4.4 cm -> annual screen.
- If 4.5 - 5.4 -> USG every 3 months.
- If >5.4 -> vascular surgery refer for treatment.

Risk factor: smoker, vascular disease. 
# Clinical Features
Else it's pulsatile abdo mass.  
Rupture symptoms: severe central abdo pain radiating to the back, CVS failure, distal ischemia. 

# Investigation
- USG is a quick diagnostic test in ED to rule out AAA as a cause of abdo or back pain and can measure the size of aortic diameter.
- CT angio is gold standard in long term as it allows to plan surgery for AAA patients.  

# DDx
[[pancreatitis|acute pancreatitis]] -> do amylase/lipase.
