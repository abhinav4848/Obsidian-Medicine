Progressive disease with family history in up to 10% of patients. 
There is progressive loss of neurons, mainly motor neurons but also damage to 
- frontal lobe
	- cognitive change, particularly in decision making, and [[frontotemporal dementia]] which may precede the symptoms of MND is is seen in 10-15% of patients. 
- loss of upper and lower motor neurons leading to mixed pattern of
	- weakness
	- spasticity
	- [[bulbar and pseudobulbar palsy|bulbar effects]]
	- affects speech and swallowing. 

# Treatment
The only treatment is Riluzole which was shown in trials to increase survival and slow the rate of progression. To be initiated by specialist. Liver and haematological function to be monitored. 

>[!Tip]- How to explain to patients
> Motor neurone disease is a condition where motor nerves become damaged and eventually stop working, causing the muscles that those damaged nerve supply to gradually lose strength. 
> 
> Muscles weakened by motor neurone disease do not recover and eventually severe disability develops. Motor neurone disease shortens life expectancy and is a fatal illness. There is variation in how quickly it progresses, and it is different in each person who has it. Unfortunately, there is no cure for motor neurone disease; however, you can be started on riluzole, a medication which aims to slow down the disease progression by a few months.
