# Clinical features 
Cough, Sputum production, fever, old age
Atypical pneumonia has dry cough.
Typical has productive cough, more rapid onset, high fever, and is usually caused by Strep -> MCC of CAP. 
# Types
## [[Haemophilus influenzae]]
Especially common in patients with COPD -> Presents as acute exacerbation of COPD. 
Reduced occurrence in children due to Hib vaccine but can cause [[Acute Epiglottitis]] in them. 

---
## Hospital acquired pneumonia
[[Co-trimoxazole]] #abx 

---
## Klebsiella pneumoniae
Generally seen in malnourished alcoholics, diabetics, elderly.
CXR: Cavitating pneumonia of upper lobes. 

---
## Legionella pneumophilia
Seen in hotel, tours. Foreign holidays. Exposure to common source of water or air conditioning. 
Another one of the atypical pneumonias.
### c/f
- **Hyponatremia** (due to SIADH)-> can cause patients presenting as confused.
- Lymphocytopenia
- Hypoalbuminemia
- Deranged LFT
- Flu-like symptoms, dry cough, relative bradycardia, confusion
### Inv
Urinary antigen
**CXR**: patchy Bi-basal consolidation
### Rx
Macrolides (Clarithromycin > Azithromycin) or tetracycline #abx 

---
## Mycoplasma pneumoniae	
Common in young adult, 
Prolonged and gradual onset
Worsening flu like symptoms precede a dry cough
### Complications
- [[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] ([[ITP]]) due to Cold agglutinins (IgM),
- [[Erythema multiforme]], Erythema nodosum
	Erythe`ma` multiforme: Mycoplas`ma`
- **Bullous myringitis**: painful vesicles on the tympanic membrane
### Less imp points
• Meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and other immune-mediated neurological diseases
• Patients aren't as septic. 
• Hyponatremia common in any pneumonia (but more in Legionella)
• Deranged LFT, 
• Peri/Myocarditis
• Acute glomerulonephritis
### Inv
• CXR: Atypical chest signs/x-ray findings. Reticular-nodular shadowing or patchy consolidation of 1 lower lobe
• Serology for diagnosis. 
### Rx
Doxycycline or a macrolide (e.g. erythro/clarithromycin preferred in atypicals in general) #abx

---
## Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (PCP)	
Yeast like fungus.  
Generally seen in patients with **HIV (CD4 < 200)**.
Presents with a dry cough, exercise-induced desaturations and the absence of chest signs

CXR: b/l consolidation, b/l perihilar interstitial shadow
### Rx
If CD < 200: Co-trimoxazole as prophylaxis. #abx
If CD < 50: Azithromycin (prophylaxis against M. avium)

---
## [[Pseudomonas]]	
Causes LRTI in Cystic fibrosis, 2nd decade onwards. 

---
## Staphylococcus aureus
Often occurs following influenza infection. (Use [[Amantadine]] to treat influenza virus)
Also in iv drug abusers, elderly.
Blood streaked sputum, pleuritic chest pain.

CXR: b/l lower lobe cavitation.

---
## Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)
Herpes `L`abialis-> Streptococca`L`
	
Commonest cause of pneumonia: Accounts for 80% of cases. 
u/l basal crackles, u/l lobar consolidation -> Lobar pneumonia.

### CXR
lobar consolidation

Productive cough, fever, chest tightness.
Especially associated with high fever, rapid onset and herpes labialis
A vaccine to pneumococcal is available.
