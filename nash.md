- steatosis - fat in the liver
- steatohepatitis - fat with inflammation, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
- progressive disease may cause fibrosis and liver cirrhosis

# Risk factors
Obesity, T2DM, hyperlipidemia, Jejuno-ileal bypass, Sudden weight loss/starvation
Insulin resistance is thought to be the key mechanism leading to steatosis.

## Diabetes & NASH
By far the most likely diagnosis in an obese type 2 diabetic is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This patient will require a liver screen, ultrasound and liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.  
  
A normal ferritin makes a diagnosis of [[haemochromatosis]] unlikely, although it should always be considered in patients with both abnormal LFTs and diabetes.
# Investigation
Don't screen for NASH, even in 'at risk' population. If incidentally seen on USG to have fatty liver, do ELF.
- **Investigation of choice**: Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) Blood test (like a triple test of Down's syndrome). 
- Assess severity of fibrosis with FIB4 & NALFD fibrosis score + Fibroscan elastography
BMI > 30 increases Hepatic echogenicity on liver USG.
ALT:AST > 2
# Treatment
Weight loss is the best first line management for NAFLD.
