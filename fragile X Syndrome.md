Fragile X Syndrome is the most common cause of inherited [[learning difficulty]]. However, not all people with FXS have a learning disability. The level of disability can range from a mild learning disability to more severe cognitive or intellectual disabilities. FXS is the most common known cause of autism or 'autistic-like' behaviours. Symptoms also can include characteristic physical and behavioral features and delays in speech and language development.

# Inheritance
X is fragile. It is quite common because it is X-linked dominant. 
If you pick up the fragile X (from your Mom or Dad), you will get it. (i.e. 25% odds if one parent has FXS).
