A syringe driver should be considered in the palliative care setting when a patient is unable to take oral medication due to nausea, dysphagia, intestinal obstruction, weakness or coma. In the UK there are two main types of syringe driver:  
- Graseby MS16A (blue): the delivery rate is given in mm per hour
- Graseby MS26 (green): the delivery rate is given in mm per 24 hours
  
The majority of drugs are compatible with water for injection although for the following drugs sodium chloride 0.9% is recommended:  
- granisetron
- ketamine
- ketorolac
- octreotide
- ondansetron
# Commonly used drugs
- nausea and vomiting: cyclizine, levomepromazine, haloperidol, metoclopramide
- respiratory secretions/bowel colic: hyoscine hydrobromide, hyoscine butylbromide, or glycopyrronium bromide.
- agitation/restlessness: midazolam, haloperidol, levomepromazine
- pain: diamorphine is the preferred opioid
  
# Mixing and compatibility issues  
- Diamorphine is compatible with the majority of other drugs used including dexamethasone, haloperidol, hyoscine butylbromide, hyoscine hydrobromide, levomepromazine, metoclopramide, midazolam
    - cyclizine may precipitate with diamorphine when given at higher doses
- Cyclizine is incompatible with a number of drugs including clonidine, dexamethasone, hyoscine butylbromide (occasional), ketamine, ketorolac, metoclopramide, midazolam, octreotide, sodium chloride 0.9%
