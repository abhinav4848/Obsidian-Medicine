Primary tumours which give rise to metastases to bone are remembered by many students by the nonsense rule that they all begin with a B. Thus:
- breast- mixed sclerotic and lytic
- [[cancer- lung|bronchus]] (Lung)- mixed sclerotic and lytic
- byroid (thyroid)
- bidney (kidney)- these mets are large and vascular. 
- brostate (prostate)- more sclerotic lesions. 
- (rarely, bowel)
Widespread bone lesions are a feature of [[melanoma]]- more osteolytic lesions. 

# Clinical Features of bone mets
- bone pain- unrelenting, progressive, could be present at rest. 
- pathological fracture
- nerve compression
- [[hypercalcemia]]
