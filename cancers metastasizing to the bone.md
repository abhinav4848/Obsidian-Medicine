Primary tumours which give rise to metastases to bone are remembered by many students by the nonsense rule that they all begin with a B. Thus:
- breast
- bronchus ([[cancer- lung|Lung]])
- byroid (thyroid)
- bidney (kidney)
- bostate (prostate)
- (rarely, bowel)
Widespread bone lesions are a feature of [[melanoma]]. 

# Clinical Features of bone mets
- bone pain- unrelenting, progressive, could be present at rest. 
- pathological fracture
- nerve compression
- [[hypercalcemia]]
