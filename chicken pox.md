Airborne spread. Spread also if contact with vesicles.
**Infectivity**: -4 & +5 days of rash appearance.

# Clinical Features

Pruritic Rash. Scratches at night. 
Lasts 4-10 days. 

# Rx: 
Healthy child/adult: **Reassure**. 
Symptomatic management -> Chlorpheniramine/calamine lotion for itch. 

> [!info]
[[School in children with rash]]: -4 to +5 days from onset of rash, or when crusted over. Keep away from pregnant women.

> [!warning]
> Don't use NSAID for fever in chicken pox cuz it can increase risk of skin infection, incl risk of gp A strep nec fasc

## Acyclovir #drug to 
- Immunocompromised who develop chicken pox, or 
- Immunocompromised **with exposure** 
	Due to shortage of IVIG, we now prescribe oral acyclovir to immunocompromised to be started from days 7-14 after exposure. Not immediately
- Pregnant who develop chicken pox & presents <24 hrs of onset of rash. 
- Pregnant >=20 weeks POG, with exposure and with no VZ antibodies -> Acyclovir 7-14 days later, unless she presents within 24 hrs. of onset of rash.
- See [[_chicken pox treatment flowchart (Work in progress).canvas|Chicken Pox treatment flowchart (Work in progress)]]

## VZIG to 
- Newborns with peri-partum exposure (-5 to +2 days of birth)
- Pregnant <20 weeks POG, with exposure and with no VZ antibodies -> VZIG is effective within 10 days of exposure. 

## Risk of superadded infection 
present in chicken pox (not in mumps) -> vesicular discharge, high fever -> Give antibiotics

## Questions
- Mother gets varicella rash > 1 week before delivery: no need for giving vzig cuz mom has adequate time to develop and transmit antibodies to the child
- Rash after 1 week of delivery: VZIg serves no benefit after this time
- During 1st week of life, baby exclusively dependent on maternal antibodies. After 1 week it starts to produce its own ab. So needs vzig while in the first week of life. 
- If neonate develops pox, give acyclovir within 24 hrs. 

## Complications of chicken pox
- Disseminated hemorrhagic chickenpox
- Secondary bacterial infection (NSAIDs may increase this risk in chicken pox)
- Encephalitis (cerebellar involvement may be seen) 
- Pneumonia
- If a baby is born with **congenital varicella**, he can develop *pneumonia* and *hepatitis* when delivered.
