GP fit note can be given after the patient has self-certified for a week. 

A fit note can be back dated, but not future dated. 

In case a patient wants a fit note but can't get it on the same day, they can tell their employer they're unwell and then when they do get their GP appointment, or even a discussion with the on-call doctor, they can ask for the fit note to be back dated.
