# Pulmonary Fibrosis
## Definition 
Refers to the end-stage scarring (fibrotic remodelling) of lung tissue resulting from chronic injury and repair.
## Key features
- Represents irreversible architectural distortion of alveoli.
- End result of chronic [[interstitial lung disease vs pneumonitis|ILD]], unresolved pneumonitis, or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).     
- Clinical hallmark: progressive dyspnoea, dry cough, restrictive pattern on spirometry, and “honeycombing” on HRCT.

In essence: Fibrosis is the scarring aftermath, the end result, not the initial process.

Compare with [[interstitial lung disease vs pneumonitis]]. 

# Clinical Features
Older patient,
progressive exertional dyspnea,
dry cough,
clubbing,
non-smoker
Fine-end inspiratory crackles.
Restrictive pattern.
# Causes
