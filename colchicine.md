# Pharmacology #notAKT 
Colchicine works mainly by:
1) Inhibiting microtubules in neutrophils
	- Neutrophils need microtubules to move, phagocytose, and degranulate.
	- Colchicine disrupts microtubules → neutrophils become sluggish → less acute inflammation. 
2) Blocking the NLRP3 inflammasome 
	- The NLRP3 inflammasome activates IL-1β, a potent inflammatory cytokine.
	- Gout and pericarditis both trigger NLRP3 activation.
## Other conditions where colchicine works (All for the same pathway reason)

- [[behcet's disease|Behçet’s disease]]
- Recurrent aphthous ulcers
- Post-pericardiotomy syndrome
