# Step down treatment of Asthma
Although, in practice, patients are typically reviewed on an annual basis with regard to asthma, guidelines recommend stepping down treatment every 3 months in well controlled asthma. 

Reduce inhaled steroids by 25-50% at a time.

# Drugs to avoid in Asthma
Beta Blockers- As salbutamol is a beta-agonist and opens airways, we can make sense that beta blocker will worsen airway constriction. 
- In pre-eclampsia with asthma, you'll choose [[calcium channel blockers|Nifedipine]] instead of Labetalol. #confusion 
Avoid aspirin & [[NSAID]]s in [[samter's triad]]

# Inhaler Technique
remove cap and shake
breathe out gently
take puff as you begin to breathe in
hold breath for >=10s as per comfort, to allow time to spread to lungs. 
Wait 30s before you repeat a puff.
