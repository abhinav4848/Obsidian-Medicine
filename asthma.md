# Diagnose Asthma
#Triad: Chest tightness, SoB, Wheezing.

Spirometry is done for diagnosis of asthma seeing improvement post bronchodilator -> Spirometry with reversibility +ve.  
A variable peak expiratory flow (even if spirometry normal) -> Asthma
Variability > 20%  seen after monitoring at least BD for 2-4 weeks

Determining right time for bronchodilators (assess severity)-> Peak flow rate diary > FeNO
- Peak flow rate diary helps with management, as well as diagnosis if doubtful.

# Attacks of asthma

## Adult stable asthma management
Adult Stable asthma management:
1. Reliever: SABA (if < 3 attacks)
2. Add regular preventer: SABA + Low dose ICS (beclomethasone)
3. SABA + low ICS + LTRA
4. SABA + low ICS + LABA +/- LTRA
5. SABA + low MART* (ICS+LABA) +/- LTRA
6. SABA + med MART (ICS+LABA) +/- LTRA
7. SABA +/- LTRA +
	1. Increase to high dose ICS (not as MART), or
	2. trial of LAMA, theophylline
	3. Seek expert opinion

\* MART: Maintenance & Reliever therapy (has fast acting LABA)

Unique case: Stable asthma, with just exercise induced SoB: LTRA > Sodium cromoglicate.

take puff and hold breath for 10s to allow time to spread to lungs. Wait 30s before next puff.

## Child stable asthma management
5-16yo: In Step 4, if LTRA hasn't helped, NICE says to stop it in children. 
<5yo: If child < 5yo, don’t give LABA 

1. **Newly-diagnosed asthma**- Short-acting beta agonist (SABA)
2. **Not controlled on previous step** OR **Newly-diagnosed asthma with symptoms >= 3/week**, OR **night-time waking** 
	1. SABA + an 8-week trial of paediatric MODERATE-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)
	2. After 8-weeks stop the ICS and monitor the child's symptoms:
		- if symptoms did not resolve during the trial period, review whether an alternative diagnosis is likely
		- if symptoms resolved, then reoccurred within **4 weeks** of stopping ICS treatment, restart the ICS at a paediatric low dose as first-line maintenance therapy
		- if symptoms resolved but reoccurred beyond 4 weeks after stopping ICS treatment, repeat the 8‑week trial of a paediatric moderate dose of ICS
3. SABA + paediatric low-dose ICS + leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA)
4. Stop the LTRA and refer to a paediatric asthma specialist

# Step down treatment
Although, in practice, patients are typically reviewed on an annual basis with regard to asthma, guidelines recommend stepping down treatment every 3 months.

Reduce inhaled steroids by 25-50% at a time.
