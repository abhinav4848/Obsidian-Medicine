# Emergency
Acute sensorineural hearing loss (in last 30 days) is an emergency and requires urgent referral to ENT for audiology assessment and brain MRI (exclude a vestibular schwannoma). 
High dose steroids are often used in acute sensorineural hearing loss, even if the cause has not been identified.

### Otosclerosis
Often occurs in early adult life. 
Tinnitus and transient vertigo may be present. 
Schwartz sign (Pink tinge on TM) #named
### Cholesteatoma
Recurrent/persistent ear discharge (foul smelling). 
CHL, ear discomfort, [[meningitis]], intracerebral abscess, facial nerve palsy.
### Meniere
D(fluctuant), [[vertigo- test & causes|Vertigo]], T. Aural fullness. 
Control acute attacks with Labyrinthine sedatives: [[cyclizine]], prochlorperazine. 
Long term prevention with beta-histine, thiazide, low salt diet.
### Presbycusis
Age related hearing loss, affects sounds at high frequency - Downward-sloping pure tone thresholds. Difficulty differentiating 's' and 'th', and finding women's voices more difficult to hear than men's. Word recognition is relatively preserved, but many eventually develop poor word distinction (particularly in crowded, noisy settings).
### Osteoma
Cold water swimmers. Ear pain. Irregularly shaped, osseous tumours in the ear canal
