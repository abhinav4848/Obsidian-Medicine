# Hepatitis A 
Incubation period: 4 weeks 
- flu-like prodrome
- abdo pain (RUQ)
- tender hepatomegaly
- jaundice
- ALT > AST 

Can be due to eating out. **Shellfish** are known reservoirs. #important 
Hepatitis A transmitted by faecal-oral route
No increased risk for HCC (Hep B has risk for HCC) 
### Who should be vaccinated? (Based on the Green book guidelines)  
- people travelling to or going to reside in areas of high or intermediate prevalence, if aged > 1 year old
- people with chronic liver disease
- patients with haemophilia
- men who have sex with men
- injecting drug users
- individuals at occupational risk: laboratory worker; staff of large residential institutions; sewage workers; people who work with primates

### How & why give HA Vaccine?
- give a booster dose 6 months after initial. 
- Although there are few long-term sequelae of HAV, tender hepatomegaly & GI upset are unpleasant & rapidly preventable with the vaccine. 
- even non-life-threatening cases can cause significant morbidity including fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain and jaundice which could last for several weeks or months.

# Hepatitis B

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HBsAg    | - Surface antigen (HBsAg) is the first marker to appear and responsible for the production of anti-HBs <br>- Normally means acute disease (present for 1-6 months) and that person is infectious except within 30 days of vaccination when it's transiently raised. <br><br>**If HBsAg is present for > 6 months**<br>- Then this means chronic disease |
| Anti-HBs | Means immunity (either by exposure or by immunization)<br>It is negative in chronic disease (i.e. disease is still active).                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Anti-HBc | Implies previous (or current) infection. Not present in vaccine.<br><br>*IgM* anti-HBc<br>- Appears during acute or recent hepatitis B infection and is present for about 6 months.<br><br>*IgG* anti-HBc persists                                                                                                                                      |
| HBeAg    | This escapes when virus replicates and is therefore a marker of infectivity.<br>Also HBV DNA indicates active viral replication & infectivity.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Anti-HBe | Response to treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

# Hepatitis C
Breastfeeding not [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|contraindicated]]. 
No vaccine 
causes the most morbidity in IVDUs
Risk of transmitting in needle stick injury -> 2% (6% if [[HIV]] too). 
## Investigation
- HCV RNA is the investigation of choice to diagnose acute infection
- HCV antibody. If positive -> HCV RNA for currently circulating virus -> if RNA -ve, repeat RNA in 6 months. 
## Associated with
- [[Sjogren's syndrome]] (Sjogren is seen with [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] & chronic hepatitis C)
- [[cancer- liver|HCC]] 
- Cryoglobulinemia (type 2-> mixed monoclonal & polyclonal),
- [[porphyria cutanea tarda]], esp. if also Alcohol abuse 
- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis 
## Treatment
Ribavirin (avoid getting [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|pregnant]] for 6 months after use as teratogenic)
