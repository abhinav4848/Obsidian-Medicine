# Hepatitis A 
Incubation period: 4 weeks 
Can be due to eating out. **Shellfish** are known reservoirs. #important 
Hepatitis A is by faecal-oral route 
ALT > AST 

No increased risk for HCC (Hep B has risk for HCC) 

---
# Hepatitis B 
^See CDC link above. 
Can have chronic hepatitis: ground glass hepatocytes on microscopy
Risk of HCC #important
### HBsAg 
- Surface antigen (HBsAg) is the first marker to appear and responsible for the production of anti-HBs 
- Normally means acute disease (present for 1-6 months) and that person is infectious except within 30 days of vaccination when it's transiently raised. 

**If HBsAg is present for > 6 months**
- Then this means chronic disease
### Anti-HBs 
Means immunity (either by exposure or by immunization)
It is negative in chronic disease (i.e. disease is still active). 
### Anti-HBc 
Implies previous (or current) infection. Not present in vaccine. 

*IgM* anti-HBc
- Appears during acute or recent hepatitis B infection and is present for about 6 months.
*IgG* anti-HBc persists
### HBeAg 
This escapes when virus replicates and is therefore a marker of infectivity.
Also HBV DNA indicates active viral replication & infectivity.
### Anti-HBe 
Response to treatment.
## Example results 
**Previous immunization:**
- Anti-HBs +ve, all others -ve 

**Previous hepatitis B (> 6 months ago), not a carrier:** 
- Anti-HBc IgG +ve, HBsAg -ve 

**Previous hepatitis B, now a carrier:** 
- Anti-HBc IgG +ve, Anti-HBc IgM -ve, HBsAg +ve

# Hepatitis C
Breastfeeding not contraindicated. 
No vaccine 
causes the most morbidity in IVDUs
Risk of transmitting in needle stick injury -> 2% (6% if HIV too). 
## Investigation
- HCV RNA is the investigation of choice to diagnose acute infection
- HCV antibody. If positive -> HCV RNA for currently circulating virus -> if RNA -ve, repeat RNA in 6 months. 
## Associated with
- [[sjogren's syndrome]] (seen with 1* biliary cirrhosis & chronic hepatitis C)
- HCC 
- Cryoglobulinemia (type 2-> mixed monoclonal & polyclonal),
- [[porphyria cutanea tarda]], esp. if also Alcohol abuse 
- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis 
## Treatment
Ribavirin (avoid getting [[drugs contraindicated in pregnancy|pregnant]] for 6 months after use as teratogenic)
