# Neuropathic pain
(except trigeminal neuralgia)
The meds are used as monotherapy & not combined. 
### First line
amitriptyline, [[duloxetine]], gabapentin or pregabalin.

- If not tolerated, offer one of the remaining 3 drugs, and consider switching again if 2nd & 3rd drugs tried are also not effective/tolerated. 
- Tramadol only if acute rescue therapy is needed. (not for long term- that's specialist recommendation only.)
- Consider Capsaicin cream for people with localised neuropathic pain (post-herpetic neuralgia) who wish to avoid/can't tolerate oral treatments. 

Don't offer morphine or long term tramadol unless specialist advice. 

Duloxetine is licensed for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain only. 
Gabapentin is for peripheral neuropathic pain only.
## Trigeminal Neuralgia
Carbamazepine as initial treatment. 
If not tolerated, consider expert advice & early referral to pain service.
