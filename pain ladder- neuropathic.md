# Conditions
- Diabetic Neuropathy
- Post herpetic neuralgia
- Trigeminal neuralgia
- Prolapsed intervertebral disc
- [[sciatica]]- not recommended. 
# Neuropathic pain
(except trigeminal neuralgia)
The meds are used as monotherapy & not combined. 
### First line
[[depression|amitriptyline]], [[duloxetine]], gabapentin or pregabalin.

- If not tolerated, offer one of the remaining 3 drugs, and consider switching again if 2nd & 3rd drugs tried are also not effective/tolerated. 
- Tramadol only if acute rescue therapy is needed. (not for long term- that's specialist recommendation only.)
	- Tramadol is dual action- weak opioid agonist, and an SNRI. 
	- Consider when other treatments have failed. 
	- From comments: *Tramadol is a horrible drug, addictive++ and multiple side effects, so people try to go for alternatives wherever they can.* 
- Consider Capsaicin cream for people with localised neuropathic pain (post-herpetic neuralgia) who wish to avoid/can't tolerate oral treatments. 
##### Licensed use
- Duloxetine is licensed for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain only. 
- Gabapentin is for peripheral neuropathic pain only.
- Don't offer morphine or long term tramadol unless specialist advice. 
## Trigeminal Neuralgia
Carbamazepine as initial treatment. 
If not tolerated, consider expert advice & early referral to pain service.
