The average woman in the UK goes through the menopause when she is 51 years old. 
**Definition**
- 12 months after the last period in women > 50 years
- 24 months after the last period in women < 50 years
So need of contraception is based on whether they fit the definition of menopause.

# FSH
Premature Menopause: <40yo
Early menopause: <45yo
- 2 results of FSH >30 IU/L 4-8 weeks apart
# Stopping contraception
If a woman >50yo wants to stop hormonal contraception, do FSH. 
- If 1 result >30 IU/L, stop contraception in 12 months
All women over age 55 can cease contraception as spontaneous conception is rare even if experiencing menses.
