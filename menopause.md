# Effects of Menopause
- Menopausal symptoms: 
	- Vasomotor symptoms e.g. hot flushes, night sweats.
	- Menstrual irregularities. 
	- Sleep disturbance.
	- Vaginal dryness.
	- Urinary problems.
	- Joint and muscle pains.
	- Loss of libido.
	- Mood changes.
	- Cognitive disturbance.
- Osteoporosis
- Loss of muscle mass & strength

# FSH
Premature Menopause: <40yo
Early menopause: <45yo
- 2 results of FSH >30 IU/L 4-8 weeks apart

# Stopping contraception
If a woman >50yo wants to stop hormonal contraception, do FSH. 
- If 1 result >30 IU/L, stop contraception in 12 months
All women over age 55 can cease contraception as spontaneous conception is rare even if experiencing menses. 

# Treatment options
- Lifestyle, 
- HRT: First line for vasomotor symptoms, low mood
- Alternatives to HRT: CBT for mood/anxiety, soy, SSRI, SNRI (Don't use fluoxetine or paroxetine for patients taking tamoxifen), Clonidine

See: [[hrt- negatives|negatives & cautions with HRT]]
## Hormone choice rationale
- Oestrogen → treats menopausal symptoms
- Progestogen → protects the endometrium from oestrogen-induced hyperplasia/cancer
- If uterus present → progestogen is mandatory (unless oestrogen is local only)
	- If they have Mirena (It is IUS LNG only), then can give oestrogen via another route. 
## Sequential (cyclical) HRT
What it is: 
- Continuous oestrogen. 
- Progestogen added for part of the cycle (usually 10–14 days/month). 
- Mimics a menstrual cycle. Bleeding is expected. 
Used for perimenopausal women with last bleeding <=12 months post-LMP. 

## Continuous combined HRT
What it is
- Oestrogen + progestogen every day

Who is it for?
- Postmenopausal women
- >= 12 months since last menstrual period
- >= 2 years post-menopause if <50 years old
# Reviews for patients on HRT
3 months after starting then at least annually
- discuss symptom control, s/e, ongoing indication
- check BP, BMI. 
### Stopping HRT
There's no end date for stopping HRT. Withdraw when risks outweigh benefits & patient happy to stop. 
Consider gradual withdrawal if high doses.
