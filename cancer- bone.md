# Management of Metastatic bone pain
Metastatic bone pain may respond to strong opioids, bisphosphonates or radiotherapy. The assertion that NSAIDs are particularly effective for metastatic bone pain is not supported by studies. Strong opioids have the lowest number needed to treat for relieving the pain and can provide quick relief, in contrast to radiotherapy and bisphosphonates. All patients, however, should be considered for referral to a clinical oncologist for consideration of further treatments such as radiotherapy
