# When to suspect RA
RA typically causes symmetrical synovitis of small joints (MCP, PIP, wrist) of hands and feet, although any synovial joint may be affected. 
- Pain — usually, this is worse at rest or during periods of inactivity.
- Swelling — around the joint (not bone swelling), giving a '==boggy==' feel on palpation. 
- Stiffness — early morning stiffness usually lasts over 1 hour (a history of prolonged morning stiffness is more helpful when forming a diagnosis than currently having morning stiffness for early RA). 

Do an MCP or MTP squeeze test:

## Other conditions causing synovitis: 
- CTD ([[systemic lupus erythematosis|SLE]]), Fibromyalgia, Infectious arthritis (Viral/bacterial), Osteoarthritis ([[RA vs osteoarthritis]]), Polyarticular [[gout]], [[polymyalgia rheumatica|PMR]], Psoriatic arthritis, [[reactive arthritis]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[septic arthritis]], [[seronegative spondyloarthropathy|seronegative arthritis]]. 
##### Involvement of DIP
- RA spares DIP (RA is synovitis driven and DIP has little synovium)
- OA loves DIP & PIP
- Psoriatic arthritis targets DIP (DIP is a key involved area), causes dactylitis & pitting nails, and affects asymmetrically
- SLE affects PIP & MCP (spars DIP)- non erosive arthritis

# Resp problems
A variety of respiratory problems may be seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis:  
- [[lung fibrosis|pulmonary fibrosis]]
- pleural effusion
- pulmonary nodules
- bronchiolitis obliterans
    - progressive dyspnoea
    - obstructive pattern on [[spirometry]]
    - centrilobular nodules, bronchial wall thickening is seen on CT
- complications of drug therapy e.g. [[methotrexate]] pneumonitis
- pleurisy
- Caplan's syndrome #named #syndrome 
    - massive fibrotic nodules with occupational coal dust exposure
- infection (possibly atypical) secondary to immunosuppression
