# Peripherally acting
### Orlistat
aka lipase inhibitor. 
Assists with weight loss, without affecting the brain or suppressing appetite. It inhibits pancreatic lipase and prevents fat breakdown in the GI tract therefore reduces intestinal absorption of fat.
Adverse effects include faecal urgency/incontinence and flatulence. A lower dose version is now available without prescription ('Alli').

It should only be prescribed as part of an overall plan for managing obesity in adults who have:  
- BMI of 28 kg/m^[2] or more with associated risk factors, or
- BMI of 30 kg/m^[2] or more
- The patient should be reviewed three months after commencing orlistat & continued only if weight loss of at least 5% at 3 months.
- orlistat is normally used for < 1 year
The new guidelines make an exception in [[diabetes treatment|type 2 diabetes]], where a lower target could be discussed with the patient.
