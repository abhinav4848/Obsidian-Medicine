# Peripherally acting
### Orlistat
aka lipase inhibitor. 
Assists with weight loss, without affecting the brain or suppressing appetite. It inhibits pancreatic lipase and prevents fat breakdown in the GI tract therefore reduces intestinal absorption of fat.
Adverse effects:
- faecal urgency/incontinence and 
- flatulence. 
A lower dose version is now available without prescription ('Alli').

It should only be prescribed as part of an overall plan for managing obesity in adults who have:  
- BMI >= 28 kg/m^[2] + associated risk factors, or
- BMI of 30 kg/m^[2] 
- The patient should be reviewed 12 weeks after commencing orlistat & continued only if weight loss of at least 5% at 3 months. (as measured at the start of drug treatment).
- orlistat is normally used for < 1 year
The new guidelines make an exception in [[diabetes treatment|type 2 diabetes]]: 
- Rates of weight loss may be slower in people with T2DM, so less strict goals (for example a loss of more than 3% of their body weight in 12 weeks) may be appropriate.
