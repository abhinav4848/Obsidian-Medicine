*See [[Psoriasis]] for all other types.* 

Guttate psoriasis is a form of acute psoriasis described as a shower of small, pink-red, scaly ‘raindrops’ that has fallen over the body. 

Guttate psoriasis usually presents with discrete, small, teardrop shape (rather than round or oval), pink scaly papules, making it easy to be mistaken for [[Pityriasis rosea]]. 

But guttate psoriasis is preceded by **streptococcal sore throat** 2-4 weeks before (particularly Tonsillitis), and is usually tear shaped rather than oval-shaped. Also Pityrisasis rosea follows lines of Langer.
