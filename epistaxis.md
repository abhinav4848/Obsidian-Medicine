# In children
### <2yo
Although minor epistaxis is common in children, it's uncommon in age <2yo. 
- epistaxis in this age group is more likely to be due to an underlying cause such as [[thrombocytopenia]], and thus a haematological malignancy. 
### General
Common causes of epistaxis in children include: 
- nose picking (most common cause)
- foreign body
- upper respiratory tract infection
- allergic rhinitis

# In Elderly
Degenerative arterial disease, [[hypertension]], blood dyscrasias, telangiectasia, tumour. Often no cause found. 
# Management
- pinch soft tip of nose for more than 10 mins. Don't keep checking and time the 10 mins. 
- apply ice pack to bridge of nose 
- sit patient up (reduces pressure within bleeding vessel)
	- lean patient forward to prevent blood entering post-nasal space. 

If not settling, check BP & if an anterior bleed point is visible. 
- if yes, try cautery with silver nitrate stick 
- if bleed stops, give antiseptic cream (Naseptin) for a week. 

If not settled/shock/bleeding disorder needing specialist treatment -> A&E.

## Different options for further treatment
Anterior Packing. Packing the other nostril should also be considered, as increasing pressure on the septum and offending vessel further may help.  

Antibiotics like Naseptin (alternative: Mupirocin in case of peanut/soy/neomycin allergies) should only be applied after bleeding has been controlled. i.e. after first aid measures/cautery -> They are applied to reduce crusting and the risk of vestibulitis. 

Cautery, typically with silver nitrate, is ideal for stopping bleeding when a clear source is located & cautery tolerated. Only cauterise one side of the septum as there is a risk of perforation.

Epistaxis that has failed all emergency management may require sphenopalatine ligation in theatre.
