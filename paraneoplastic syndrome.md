# Lung
*See [[cancer- lung]].* 
## Small cell carcinoma
- Releases ADH -> [[SIADH]] -> Dilutional hyponatremia, Hypokalemia
- ACTH -> Cushing
- **Lambert-Eaton**: Antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels. Same as Myasthenia gravis, but: Reflexes are absent and elicited after exercise. Increased strength/power of weakened muscle after repeated test.

## Squamous cell carcinoma
SCC bronchus -> Releases PTH like molecules -> [[Hypercalcemia]]. 
More common than SIADH.
- Serum PTH will be low (1* & 3* Hyperparathyroidism ruled out)
- Then check ALP -> high ALP (+ high Ca) means bone metastasis.

Clubbing, Hyperthyroidism due to ectopic TSH.
