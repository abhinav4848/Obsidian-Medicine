# Alternans
Strong and weak beat occuring alternatively due to alternate, rather than regular contactions of muscle fibres of LV in LVF. So we get a strong beat followed by a weak beat.
# Bigeminy
Premature ventricular complex following each normal complex. In the absence of underlying heart disease, bigeminy is not significant, but following an MI, may indicate increased risk of death.

Causes of premature ventricular beats: smoke, alcohol, Hyperthyroidism, hyperAlkalemia, hypercalcemia, Digoxin, [[Quinine]], TCAs.

# Bisferiens
Rapid rising, twice beating pulse where both waves are felt during systole.  
Mixed AS & incompetence, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.
# Paradoxus
Decrease in palpable pulse and arterial SBP of 10mm Hg on inspiration.
# Trigeminy
Premature ventricular complex follows two normal QRS complexes.
