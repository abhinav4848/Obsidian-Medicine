# Risk Factors
[[cancer- risk factors|Family history]] (BRCA 1,2) > age is the biggest risk factor.  
Increased ovulations (early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity).
	So Pregnancy, [[cancer- drugs involved in gynae cancers|COCP]] are **protective** against ovarian cancer.
	#Mnemonic: *OCP: ovarian cancer protection. Because OCP reduces number of ovulations. As well as pregnancy does same.*

HRT increases ovarian cancer risk in those using it for > 5 years.
# Clinical Features
- Abdominal discomfort, distension, bloating, cramp.
- Early satiety and loss of appetite.
- Pelvic/Abdominal pain.

# Investigation
Any woman over age 50 with new [[irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]] like symptoms within the past year, do [[tumour marker|CA-125]]. If > 35IU/ml, do USG abdomen and pelvis.

Don't use CA-125 to screen for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women.
