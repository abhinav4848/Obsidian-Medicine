In a heavy smoker, symptoms of Horner syndrome combined with ipsilateral shoulder and arm pain are concerning for a Pancoast tumour.

Compression of the stellate ganglion by a Pancoast tumour can lead to Horner syndrome via injury of preganglionic sympathetic fibres.

Superior sulcus tumours can infiltrate neighbouring structures and cause additional symptoms, which is known as 
Pancoast #syndrome: 
- shoulder and arm pain, 
- atrophy of the arm and hand muscles,  
- possibly superior vena cava syndrome, and 
- hoarseness due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. 

The most common cause of Pancoast syndrome is NSCLC: history of smoking.
