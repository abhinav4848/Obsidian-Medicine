# Cause
## Diseases: 
Seen in Polycythemia, [[leukemia]], Tumor lysis syndrome, Psoriasis, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (self mutilating disorder due to buildup of uric acid). 
## Drugs
#mnemonic : FACT 
Furosemide, Alcohol excess, [[Cytotoxic drugs]] (cyclosporine), [[_side effects of cvs drugs|thiazide]], Pyrazinamide
## Foods
High purine containing: Liver, Kidneys, Seafood, oily fish (mackerel, sardines), and yeast products. 

# Investigations
Test uric acid 6 weeks after acute attack, because during attack levels are raised.

# Treatment
## Acute management
Give Naproxen, Ibuprofen in acute mx > Colchicine is 2nd line cuz of s/e (GIT, Renal).
	Don't give NSAID if already on blood thinner. 
	Ask patient to stop taking statins if giving colchicene cuz risk of rhabdo.
	Just like we ask patients to not take statins when giving macrolide.  
## Long term
Allopurinol is only started after symptoms settle > Febuxostat if not tolerated. 
Colchicene cover is given when starting allopurinol. 
	NSAID used if colchicene not tolerated. 

Don't treat asymptomatic hyperuricemia. 

# Contraindications
1. Aspirin (low dose) **not** given in gout as it can worsen it. 
2. NSAID not given in renal impairment/asthma/HF/IHD -> Give Steroid/Colchicene instead. 
3. Allopurinol reduces clearance of
	a. [[Azathioprine]] (prodrug of 6-MP) clearance -> Immunosuppression -> Neutropenic sepsis
	b. Cyclophosphamide -> Marrow toxicity
	c. Theophylline
