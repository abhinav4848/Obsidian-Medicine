# Cause
## Diseases: 
Seen in Polycythemia, [[leukemia|leukaemia]], [[tumour lysis syndrome]], Psoriasis, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (self mutilating disorder due to buildup of uric acid). 
## Drugs
#mnemonic : FACT 
Furosemide, Alcohol excess, [[Cytotoxic drugs]] (cyclosporine), [[side effects of cvs drugs|thiazide]], Pyrazinamide
Drugs used for CHF cause gout: Thiazide, loop diuretics (prescribed first). 
## Foods
High purine containing: Liver, Kidneys, Seafood, oily fish (mackerel, sardines), and yeast products. 

# Investigations
Test uric acid 6 weeks after acute attack, because during attack levels are raised.

# Treatment
## Acute management
Give Naproxen, Ibuprofen in acute mx > Colchicine is 2nd line cuz of s/e (GIT, Renal).
	Don't give [[NSAID]] if already on blood thinner. 
	Ask patient to stop taking statins if giving colchicine cuz risk of rhabdo. #important 
	Just like we ask patients to not take [[statins]] when giving macrolide. 
## Long term
Allopurinol is only started after symptoms settle > Febuxostat if not tolerated. 
Colchicine cover is given when starting allopurinol. 
	NSAID used if Colchicine not tolerated. 
	Drugs used for Gout cause worsening of renal failure, heart failure (SOB and Dyspnoea):
Give other Gout drugs instead like Colchicine, Prednisolone.

Don't treat asymptomatic hyperuricemia. 
# Contraindications
1. Aspirin (low dose) **not** given in gout as it can worsen it. 
2. [[NSAID]] not given in renal impairment/[[asthma]]/HF/IHD -> Give Steroid/Colchicine instead. 
3. Allopurinol reduces clearance of some meds. See [[allopurinol]].
