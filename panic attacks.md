# Generalised anxiety disorder
- having a number of different worries that are excessive and out of proportion to a particular situation    
- having difficulty controlling one's worries.

Always look for a potential physical cause when considering a psychiatric diagnosis. In anxiety disorders, important alternative causes include [[hyperthyroidism]], cardiac disease and medication-induced anxiety (NICE). Medications that may trigger anxiety include salbutamol, theophylline, [[corticosteroid|corticosteroids]], [[depression|antidepressants]] and caffeine. 
# Treatment
1. CBT
2. SSRIs (Sertraline, etc. but never Fluoxetine)
3. TCA (if SSRI c/I or no response in 12 weeks): Imipramine, clomipramine
## CBT (Stepped care model)
[NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg113/chapter/Recommendations#stepped-care-for-people-with-gad) 
- **step 1**: education about GAD + active monitoring
- **step 2**: low-intensity psychological interventions (individual non-facilitated self-help or individual guided self-help or psychoeducational groups)
- **step 3**: high-intensity psychological interventions (cognitive behavioural therapy or applied relaxation) or drug treatment. See drug treatment below for more information
- **step 4**: highly specialist input e.g. Multi agency teams
## Drug treatment  
- NICE suggest [[depression|sertraline]] should be considered the first-line SSRI
	- Be aware when prescribing SSRIs of the need to ask about cocaine use when considering drug–drug interactions, and the need to avoid concurrent use of multiple serotonergic drugs.
- if sertraline is ineffective, offer an alternative SSRI or a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)
    - SNRI: duloxetine and venlafaxine
    - the risk of suicide and likelihood of toxicity in overdose (especially with venlafaxine)
    - tendency to produce a withdrawal syndrome (especially with paroxetine and venlafaxine)
- If the person cannot tolerate SSRIs or SNRIs, consider offering **pregabalin**
- interestingly for patients under the age of 30 years NICE recommend you warn patients of the increased risk of suicidal thinking and self-harm. Weekly follow-up is recommended for the first month
# Acute Treatment 
**Before attack trigger is anticipated**: Propranolol
**During attack**: Rebreathe into a paper bag > BZD
