# Generalised anxiety disorder
- having a number of different worries that are excessive and out of proportion to a particular situation    
- having difficulty controlling one's worries.

Always look for a potential physical cause when considering a psychiatric diagnosis. In anxiety disorders, important alternative causes include [[hyperthyroidism]], cardiac disease and medication-induced anxiety (NICE). Medications that may trigger anxiety include salbutamol, theophylline, [[corticosteroid|corticosteroids]], [[depression|antidepressants]] and caffeine. 
# Treatment for GAD
## Stepped care model
[NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg113/chapter/Recommendations#stepped-care-for-people-with-gad) 
- **step 1**: education about GAD + active monitoring
- **step 2**: low-intensity psychological interventions (individual non-facilitated self-help or individual guided self-help or psychoeducational groups)
- **step 3**: high-intensity psychological interventions (cognitive behavioural therapy or applied relaxation) or drug treatment, or both. See drug treatment. 
- **step 4**: highly specialist input e.g. Multi agency teams
### Drug treatment 
- NICE suggest [[depression|sertraline]] should be considered the first-line SSRI
	- Sertraline is off-license for this use, so Informed consent should be obtained and documented. 
- if sertraline is ineffective, offer an alternative SSRI or a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)
    - SNRI: [[duloxetine]] and venlafaxine 
    - tendency to produce a withdrawal syndrome (especially with paroxetine and venlafaxine)
- Pregabalin if cannot tolerate SSRIs or SNRIs. 
	- Don't offer Benzodiazepines or anti-psychotic. 
- interestingly for patients under the age of 30 years NICE recommend you warn patients of the increased risk of suicidal thinking and self-harm. Weekly follow-up is recommended for the first month

See [[ssri#Side Effects of SSRIs|Side effects of SSRIs]].
