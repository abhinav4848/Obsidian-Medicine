Antipsychotic drugs are aka neuroleptics/anti-schizophrenic drugs. 
Useful in psychosis, mania & bipolar disorders, intractable hiccups, [[antiemetics|N&V]], delirium.

Antipsychotics counter the effects of dopamine excess in [[delirium]], psychosis, nausea (stimulation of [[areas of brain|area postrema]]), aggression (stimulation of [[areas of brain|nucleus accumbens]]). However, unopposed D2 antagonism can cause dopamine depletion symptoms in other pathways ([[extrapyramidal side-effects|EPS]]), and worsening of negative psychotic symptoms (e.g. apathy, anhedonia). 
# Typical
**Mechanism**: [[D2 antagonism]]. 
**Examples**: [[Haloperidol]], Chlorpromazine, Flupentixol, Prochlorperazine. 
**Side effects**: [[Extrapyramidal side-effects]] (EPSEs) more common

# Atypical
**Mechanism**: Many different receptors.  
**Examples**: Clozapine, Olanzapine, Risperidone, Quetiapine, Aripiprazole
**Side Effects**: 
- EPS less common than typicals
- Clozapine: agranulocytosis 
- Olanazapine: High risk of dyslipidemia and obesity.
- Greater lowering of seizure thresholds than typicals.

# Other Side effects (for both)
HAM side effects: Found in [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCA’s) and low potency antipsychotics. 

#mnemonic : HAMd
- Anti-Histamine: 
	- sedation, 
	- weight gain
- Anti-Adrenergic: 
	- Hypotension;
- [[anticholinergics|Anti-Muscarinic]]: 
	- dry mouth, 
	- blurred vision, 
	- urinary retention, 
	- constipation, 
	- can exacerbate Alzheimer's.
- Anti-Dopamine: Raised prolactin. 
    - may result in galactorrhoea
    - [[Gynaecomastia]]

- impaired glucose tolerance
- [[fever caused by drugs|Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]
	- Especially with Clozapine
	- pyrexia, muscle stiffness (lead pipe rigidity)
	- Rx with iv **dantrolene** #antidote 
- reduced seizure threshold (greater with atypical antipsychotics)
- [[qt prolongation]] (particularly haloperidol)

VTE risk in elderly. i.e. Stroke. Olanzapine MCC.
