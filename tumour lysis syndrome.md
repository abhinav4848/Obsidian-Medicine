Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a metabolic emergency that occurs when large numbers of tumour cells are rapidly destroyed, releasing their contents into the bloodstream. It typically presents with [[hyperkalemia]], hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia, and hyperuricaemia, leading to acute kidney injury, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, or death. 

TLS usually occurs during the initiation of chemotherapy rather than after completion.
