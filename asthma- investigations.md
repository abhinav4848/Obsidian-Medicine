# Eosinophils 
Eosinophils are specifically involved in type 2 inflammation, a key immunological pathway in many asthma phenotypes, making them a targeted marker for disease activity. Unlike other white blood cells, eosinophils play a direct role in airway inflammation by releasing granules containing cytotoxic proteins like eosinophil peroxidase and major basic protein, which damage epithelial cells and perpetuate inflammation. Additionally, eosinophils are activated by interleukin-5 (IL-5) and other cytokines in the type 2 pathway, distinguishing them from neutrophils or lymphocytes, which are more associated with other immune responses. IL-5 is an important target new monoclonal antibody treatments such as mepolizumab.  
  
# Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)
FeNO reflects the level of nitric oxide produced by airway epithelial cells in response to eosinophilic inflammation, a hallmark of [[asthma- diagnosis#First line investigation|asthma]]. It is measured non-invasively by having the patient exhale steadily into a handheld device, which analyses nitric oxide concentration in parts per billion (ppb).  
  
# Bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) testing with spirometry 
Bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) testing with [[spirometry]] evaluates the degree of airflow limitation that improves after administration of a bronchodilator, a key diagnostic feature of asthma. In asthma, airway obstruction results primarily from reversible bronchial smooth muscle constriction and airway inflammation, which can respond to bronchodilators by relaxing the smooth muscle and reducing resistance. Measuring FEV1 before and after bronchodilator administration demonstrates this reversibility, with an increase of ≥12% and ≥200 mL indicating significant improvement. This reversibility distinguishes [[asthma]] from fixed airway obstruction seen in conditions like [[COPD]], where airflow limitation is less responsive.  
  
# Peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability
Peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability reflects diurnal changes in airway calibre, a hallmark of asthma, due to underlying circadian rhythms in airway inflammation and bronchial smooth muscle tone. Airway narrowing tends to worsen at night and in the early morning due to increased parasympathetic activity, nocturnal histamine release, and lower circulating cortisol levels, all of which contribute to heightened airway hyperresponsiveness. This diurnal pattern, with a >20% variation in PEF between morning and evening values, supports the diagnosis of [[asthma]] and highlights its dynamic, reversible nature.  
  
# Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a central role in allergic asthma by mediating hypersensitivity reactions through binding to high-affinity IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils. Upon allergen exposure, cross-linking of bound IgE triggers the release of inflammatory mediators like histamine and leukotrienes, leading to airway inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and asthma symptoms. Measuring serum IgE levels helps identify atopic asthma phenotypes, predict responsiveness to anti-IgE therapy such as omalizumab, and guide management strategies in patients with allergic triggers.  
  
# Skin prick testing
Skin prick testing for house dust mite is performed because it is a common and potent trigger for asthma, particularly in atopic individuals. House dust mite allergens, found in household dust, are inhaled and can lead to chronic airway inflammation, increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and exacerbations in susceptible individuals. Identifying house dust mite sensitivity allows targeted interventions, such as allergen avoidance measures, to improve asthma control and reduce symptom burden.  
  
# Bronchial challenge test
Bronchial challenge test assesses airway hyperresponsiveness, a characteristic feature of asthma, by measuring the airway's response to a provocative agent such as methacholine or histamine. In asthma, heightened bronchial smooth muscle reactivity and inflammation lead to excessive narrowing of the airways when exposed to these agents, resulting in a significant decline in [[spirometry|FEV1]].
