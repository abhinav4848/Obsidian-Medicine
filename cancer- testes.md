Age: 20-30yo. 
- Peak for Teratoma: 25yo
- Peak for Seminoma: 35yo

# Types
Most Testicular cancers are: 
- Germ Cell tumours, which can be
	1. Seminomas
	2. Non-Seminomas (e.g. embryonal, yolk sac, teratoma and choriocarcinoma)
- Non-Germ Cell tumours
	1. Leydig cells
	2. Sarcomas

# Risk Factors
- infertility (increases risk by a factor of 3)
- [[undescended testes|Cryptorchidism]]
- [[cancer- risk factors|family history]]
- Klinefelter's syndrome
- [[mumps]] orchitis

# Clinical Features
- Painless lump, hard, irregular, not fluctuant, can't transilluminate
- Pain in minority
- Hydrocele- can be the first sign of cancer.
	- new hydroceles in males aged 20-40 years old must be investigated by way of urgent scrotal ultrasound.
- [[gynaecomastia]]
	- This is due to high E:A ration
	- germ-cell tumours → hCG → Leydig cell dysfunction → increases in both oestradiol and testosterone production, but rise in oestradiol is relatively greater than testosterone
	- Leydig cell tumours → directly secrete more oestradiol and convert additional androgen precursors to oestrogens

# Investigation
USS
# Management
- treatment depends on whether the tumour is a seminoma or a non-seminoma
- orchidectomy
- chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be given depending on staging and tumour type

Prognosis is generally excellent  
- 5 year survival for seminomas is around 95% if Stage I
- 5 year survival for teratomas is around 85% if Stage I
