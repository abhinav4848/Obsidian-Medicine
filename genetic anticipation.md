With genetic anticipation, hereditary diseases have an earlier age of onset through successive generations. 

Trinucleotide repeat disorders are genetic conditions caused by an abnormal number of repeats (expansions) of a repetitive sequence of three nucleotides. These expansions are unstable and may enlarge which may lead to an earlier age of onset in successive generations - a phenomenon known as anticipation*. In most cases, an increase in the severity of symptoms is also noted. 
  
Examples - note dominance of neurological disorders  
- [[Fragile X Syndrome]] (CGG)
- Huntington's (CAG)
- myotonic dystrophy (CTG)
- Friedreich's ataxia* (GAA)
- spinocerebellar ataxia
- spinobulbar muscular atrophy
- dentato-rubral pallidol-uysian atrophy

  
*Friedreich's ataxia is unusual in not demonstrating anticipation
